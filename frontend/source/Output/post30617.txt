Why is my inactive memory not getting free? <body> When my MacBook Pro (13" 2010, Intel C2D 2.4 GHz, 4GB RAM 1067 MHz DDR3, running Snow Leopard) runs out of free memory, instead of releasing inactive memory (which is mostly about 500 - 1000 MB), it starts to write to disk (raising page outs).   Here are processes that are running on my macbook:  precodeActive Memory: 1.64 GB Free Memory: 1.04 GB Wired Memory: 724.7 MB Used Memory: 2.96 GB Inactive Memory: 627.7 MB Total VM: 176.36 GB Number

replacement mechanism.  If you want to force it to claim back inactive memory, just code$ purge/code . Xcode required.  <comment35114> You do realize that your question is extremely generic and without access to the sort of processes that are running in your Macbook Pro, some hardware information and such, it would be close to impossible to answer this question, don't you? <comment35116> no I don't... I thought that somebody had this experience before and could have at least an idea... but OK I will try to add some more information. Thanks <comment35117> we do our best to answer all the questions, but just mentioning that your inactive memory doesn't get released as free is impossible to guess out of nowhere. Try to be more specific. Thanks. <comment35123> Are you asking out of curiosity or are you experiencing performance problems? <comment35126> Performance problems...it's driving me crazy when I hear disk working and see how the system is so slow... I was using safari as my browser, and it was consuming too much memory and mostly I had page outs about 40% of page ins (I've read somwhere it should be less then 20%), so I switched today to chrome, which is more memory efficient, but still... this changes nothing about not getting inactive memory free <comment35139> now I've tried to run out of free memory by opening many tabs in chrome and as I was getting to zero of free memory, inactive memory even raised from 600 MB to 1000 MB and stayed so. And page outs of course raised too. How is this possible ??? <comment35140> and as I add even more tabs in chrome, it does nothing with inactive memory, just page outs are higher and higher, inactive memory still about 1 GB <comment35195> I'm not sure if this is going to help you, but there's an app on the app store called Free Memory. It frees your inactive memory so that might help you in this situation. <comment35196> The comment system isn't a place to chat or add additional information to your question. Use the edit button for that, please. As for your memory problem, I don't think there is one. Inactive memory isn't freed when it's no longer being actively used. That's now how it works. Read Apple's support page for a better understanding: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1342 Also you have provided nearly everything but your swap size (which would be huge if the system is behaving as you claim "poorly").
