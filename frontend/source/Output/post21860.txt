Accesing iphone gps position from the macbook? <body> I observed that an ipad (wifi) connected to a personal hotspot made by an iphone does get also the GPS position.  The question is how can I get this from a MacBook Pro?  I would like to use it with apps like Google Earth.  <answer21861> I don't have an iPhone 4 to test this, but I assume Core Location will do.  Here's a simple sample application with a map (and coordinates).  Lucubrator is also an option, and comes with some more information.
