How do I get archive to work in Mail.app in Lion? <body> I can't get archive to work on Lion. When I choose archive in Mail.app it creates a folder called Archived. That's not what I want. When I choose delete it doesn't remove the message from my inbox. It is just greyed out. Right now I leave the messages in the inbox and archive them from my iPhone, which works great. Please help me get this working.  <answer23448> If you're okay using Mail's delete function as archive, then simply go into Mail  Preferences  Accounts  Gmail  Mailbox Behaviors and emdeselect/em both of these options:  [ ] Move deleted messages to the Trash mailbox  [ ] Store deleted messages on the server  Screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iy4OJ.png" alt="Screenshot of settings"  Then when you delete a message in Mail, you'll be archiving it.

Just enable auto-expunge.
