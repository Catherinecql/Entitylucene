How do I keep my session when I reboot in OS X? <body> When I reboot my machine, I'd like it to reopen all my programs and windows, and put them back in the same place, after restarting. how do I do this?  (I'm on 10.6, and use spaces)  <answer2748> I started an Applescript to start up the applications that make the core of my day, though I need to add in more functionality like opening specific URLs and folders (though it wouldn't be hard, I just haven't had the time).  precodetell application "Firefox"     activate end tell  tell application "Versions"     activate end tell  tell application "NetNewsWire"     activate end tell /code/pre  I saved it as an application, named it "AM" and it sits on the far left of my Dock. I come into my office in morning, wake up my Mac, and click the icon.  <answer2749> You can start as many application at startup by adding them to your Account Prefs :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5cq2.png" alt="alt text"  For the windows... I don't think there is an easy way to do it. But if it's some documents, you can added them the same way.  <answer2755> ReLaunch does what you want. Also see a similar question on SuperUser.  The only major limitation of Relaunch is it does not (yet) support Spaces (virtual desktops).  <comment2450> Please let ReLaunch developer know you'd like spaces support. Might help get it implemented... <comment2452> You can use Login Items in the Accounts section of System Preferences to do this. <comment2467> Yes, but I don't shut down my Mac except for a weekly reboot on Monday mornings.
