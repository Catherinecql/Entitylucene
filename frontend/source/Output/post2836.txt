Are there any consumer style websites that offer WebDav support? <body> iWork for iPad now has WebDav export/import options, DropBox doesn't support WebDav.  Where can I find a service that has WebDav support? Besides setting up my own server, is there any consumer (and ideally free) site that does this?  <answer2855> I believe you are looking for Box.NET. It has WebDav access (among other things)  (Source).  <answer2879> The Omni Group Forum thread, List of free webDAV sync providers, has links to a number of  possibilities.
