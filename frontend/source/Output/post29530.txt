Does apple get any payment for the Wired magazine viewer App? <body> If you are subscribed to Wired magazine (paid subscription) you can download the Wired iPad app free and enter your Subscription # and view it on the iPad.  <answer29533> No, Apple doesn't get any payment this way. There are a lot of newspapers, magazines etc. providing apps which allow electronic access. If they would offer in-app purchases Apple would take the usual 30%.
