Excel CSV export encoding <body> According to my tests, Excel on Mac, when asked to save data as CSV file, uses MacRoman encoding. My questions are:  ol liDoes it always happen or there is some setting that controls it? /li liIf there's a setting, is there a way to make it save as UTF-8? If not, is there a way to export Excel file with characters not in MacRoman preserving these characters? /li /ol  <answer15683> Having done a fair amount of research on this I think I can safely say that you can't change the export encoding. However what you could do is add a step to your export procedure whereby after saving the csv to disk you could open it in a text editor (I used Coda but quite a few others will do this) and use that to then save it out using another encoding.  <answer15690> I have found a blog post which outlines an Applescript solution to a similar problem. I've adapted it to your needs. Note that I haven't done any proper quoting of cell values or anything, it will need some tweaking to be more robust. It's also not the fastest solution in my minimal testing… but it's a start.  The key is codewrite X to openFile as «class utf8»/code  precodetell application "Microsoft Excel"     activate      set outFile to (path of active workbook)     set fileName to (name of active workbook)     set outFile to (outFile &amp; ":" &amp; fileName &amp; ".csv")     set openFile to open for access file outFile with write permission     set eof openFile to 0      set lastCol to count of columns of used range of active sheet     set lastRow to count of rows of used range of active sheet      repeat with r from 1 to lastRow         set rowStr to (value of cell r of column 1 of active sheet)         repeat with c from 2 to lastCol             set cellVal to (value of cell r of column c of active sheet)             set rowStr to rowStr &amp; "," &amp; cellVal         end repeat         write rowStr &amp; return to openFile as «class utf8»     end repeat     close access openFile     end tell /code/pre  <answer31513> I found the easiest thing to do was to just let excel export to csv in its own dumb way, then open up a terminal and do the following:  precodeiconv -t UTF8 -f MACROMAN &lt; file.csv &gt; file-utf8.csv /code/pre  <answer43779> Simply use an editor like "Editra" - Open the csv-file - Change the encoding, e.g. to UTF-8, by klicking the encoding-type in the status bar of editor window - Save the file again (it is now UTF-8) - Done :o)  <answer93576> Use Open Office to save the csv file. There you can choose the encoding.  <answer112098> Why not just simply open the created file in TextEdit and then use cmd+shift+S to save a duplicate and then choose from dropdownlist UTF-8?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/28uM6.png" alt="enter image description here"  The big advantage is that you do not have to know explicit the encoding created by Excel like in method proposed by Bart. For my language (polsih) it was not Macroman, but some variation of it.  <comment36270> yes, that's an option, but unfortunately when dealing with end-users it's awkward to tell them to open terminal and use iconv before importing their Excel files... <comment36746> @StasM Fair enough.   I did some searching around myself, but sadly it doesn't seem to be possible to have excel export as UTF-8.  After that, I just went with the easiest solution for me personally.   If you are working with end-users, this may not be the best solution. <comment49783> Hello and welcome to Ask Different! Thanks for posting an answer. Could you please add a link to the software that you mentioned? Thanks! <comment244582> This just saved the life of a non-geek user who shall remain anonymous. Very effective because of the input encoding auto-detection performed by TextEdit.
