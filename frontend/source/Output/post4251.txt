iPod Touch (4gen) camera: video same resolution as still camera? <body> I want to take a photo of something (an arm injury!), and I  think it'll be hard to hold the camera in just the right place while I hit the touchscreen-shutter.  But I could put it in video mode, and then pick out a good frame later.  Does the video taken by the iPod Touch have the same resolution/quality as a still frame captured by its camera?  <answer4255> It's a bit crazy, but on the 4th gen iPod touch the video is actually emhigher/em resolution than the still pictures:     h3Cameras, photos, and video/h3      ul   liVideo recording, HD (720p) up to 30 frames per second with audio; still photos (960 x 720) with back camera/li   /ul   720p video is 1280x720, whereas the photos taken are only 960x720.
