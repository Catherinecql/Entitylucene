Thunderbolt to VGA <body> I'm buying a new MacBook Pro tomorrow, but I'm unsure on which adapter to buy for a VGA adapter. Is it the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter? The MacBook Pro doesn't say it has a Mini DisplayPort, only Thunderbolt. So am I going to buy the correct one?  <answer24841> Yes.  Thunderbolt strongis/strong Mini DisplayPort for all purposes. (Note: not all empractical/em purposes, emall/em purposes.) Technically, Thunderbolt is PCI Express and DisplayPort multiplexed, the upshot being that every Thunderbolt port is a MDP port and can be used exactly the same as a normal Mini DisplayPort port. This fact is unchanged as you travel down the daisy-chain of Thunderbolt devices (assuming you have any).
