Configure mail client for Adobe Acrobat plugin 9.4.0 <body> Adobe Acrobat plugin 9.4.0 has File | Attach to Email ..., but selecting it yields the following:     The SendMail doesn't know how to talk   to your default mail client.  Please   select a different mail application to   use.   How does the user select which mail application for SendMail to use, and which mail applications does SendMail know how to use?  <answer5075> I believe it looks to see which is your default mail app.  I also think that it will pretty much only work with Mail.app.  If you go into Mail.app, check which is the default email app (and re-set it, if required) on the Preferences - General screen.  I bet setting it to Mail will fix your problem.  <comment5163> That was it!  My default email had been set to a web-mail's notifier.  Changing it to Mail made Acrobat happy.
