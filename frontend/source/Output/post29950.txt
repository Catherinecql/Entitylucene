How do I stop iCal from automatically adding alarms to new events? <body> I am running iCal on Snow Leopard and, whenever I add a new all day event, two alarms are automatically added, but only after I save the event. There are no alarms present when I create the event; they only appear afterwards.  How do I stop this from happening?  <answer29951> Check the settings of the calendar service you are syncing with.  If you are adding an event to a Google calendar it will apply the notification settings of that calendar. You can manage the notification preferences within Google Calendar.  <answer29993> There is an option in the preferences "General" tab, called "Add a default alarm to all new events and invitations". Maybe that's activated?
