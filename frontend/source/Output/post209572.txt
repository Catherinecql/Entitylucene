How to use pip after the OS X El Capitan upgrade? <body> After the El Capitan update, I am unable to run pip install. The error I get is that the "operation is not permitted" when pip tries to create new folders while installing.  precodecreating /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/share     error: could not create '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/share': Operation not permitted /code/pre  In fact, in general I cannot create folders etc in these folders. Have tried using sudo that doesn't help. Also I have done   precodesudo chflags nouchg /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/ /code/pre  The above didn't help either. What can I do to be able to install python libraries smoothly again?  <answer209577> I think its because of the strongSIP/strong or strongSystem Integrity Protection/strong, a kind of real-time file protection that feels like a windows anti-virus :) and stops any changes you want to make in the OS X system folders. Apple simply decided to disable system modifications – to be sure you are fully protected from the evil of internet and other computer related evil forces strongSIP/strong is protecting us from.  If you want to strongdisable SIP/strong you need to boot into Recovery HD by holding strongCommand + R/strong keys simultaneously as you boot your Mac.  Open the terminal from the Utilities menu, and type in codecsrutil disable/code, then press return. Go to the Apple Menu to reboot.   SIP would be disabled from now on. I disabled it long time ago and haven't noticed anything wrong, some processes seems to complain but they always do on OS X so i'm not sure if it's caused by the lack of System Integrity 'protection'  My tip is to entirely get rid of SIP and/or use homebrew for all of your opensource/development software. Homebrew uses the /usr/local directory for it's installment and is not colliding with other system components, and stronghomebrew/strong builds are more up-to-date then the os x apple builds.  <answer209583> A quick solution is to use homebrew to install codepython/code into code/usr/local/bin/code so that your codepip/code can run against a user-modifiable python framework.  precodebrew install python pip --version /code/pre  Disabling System Integrity Protection is also an option, but I don't recommend that for anything but professionally managed and fire walled servers where you have the manpower to manage intrusion detection or if you are a developer/sysadmin and need to test things with and without SIP.  precodels -lO /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/ csrutil status /code/pre  You will see that the strongrestricted/strong flag is set which cannot be removed even as root while SIP is engaged.  Using homebrew makes it possible to manage pip and python separately than the system provided version. As a bonus, the homebrew framework is designed to ease maintainance and patch/chores via automation.   <answer210021> First, you're not disabling SIP as a way to address the issue. Sorry that's the reason that this folder creation is failing, but we have to work around it. Second, you lose all the niceties Apple thought they were giving you, like a bridge via pyObjC, when you install your own Python.br (I'll admit, they say you should install your own to code/usr/local/code if you're a developer, I just object to doing it the easy way with brew.)    Logically, you'd think to install it somewhere SIP isn't blocking you, and this is almost certainly some dependency pip is resolving for you. Telling pip where you want it to perform installs isn't the remedy as much as having it ignore the pre-existing stuff in /System, which is where it would check for dependencies for many common installs that need, e.g.codesix/code, and SIP causes pip to break itself when it goes to try and upgrade it. It's actually pip's default behavior to install to /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages, you just need to say code--ignore-installed/code to force it to install any updated versions of dependencies there.br ...Unfortunately, you may then go to import this module in an interactive session or script and get nice fat failures - it's still looking at /System's un-upgraded package!  Since early setuptools days, Python has a way to make that lookup explicit. It's a bit odd-looking, (and should elicit pause to those of us who are security-conscious and not thrilled about the bluntness of shoving it to the top of the list without checking, but) you can place a file that ends with code.pth/code (e.g. 'elcap.pth') in code/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/code to push that directory to the front of the lookup order with the following contents:br code import sys; sys.path = ['/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages'] + sys.path /code  Start a new session, and a quick trip to codepython -m site/code will confirm that you've inserted that path into the first slot, and importing modules should work.    Oh, and after all this, try just installing with pip's code--user/code option, or using a virtualenv - that's best practice for most folks anyway.  <answer213330> Used codepip3 install &lt;package&gt;/code instead and solved the permission problem in codepip/code.  <answer214636> Another viable option without a need to disable SIP or install other Python versions, is to install the modules only for the current user using   precodepip install --user &lt;modulename&gt; /code/pre  If it is just your personal machine, this would be the simplest and safest solution.  <answer215706> I did it as follows:  precodebrew install python /code/pre  then after python is installed:  precodesudo easy_install pip /code/pre  <answer223163> This problem often arises when pip tries to install a manpage for IPython on El Capitan. The quick fix is to use a pip command like this:  precodesudo -H pip install --install-option '--install-data=/usr/local' &lt;package&gt; /code/pre  However, System Integrity Protection (SIP) on El Capitan blocks several bad practices with pip that used to slide by, so you will probably need to make some more changes to get pip running smoothly on El Capitan.  SIP on El Capitan exposes three problems with using pip with the Apple-supplied version of Python on OS X:   ol lidistutils does not set two important variables correctly on Macs, so pip tries to write headers and other shared files (e.g., manpages) under code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7//code. This is a bad idea, but in earlier versions of OS X, it succeeded if pip was run with sudo. However it fails on El Capitan due to SIP. This is the error you ran into. It gives messages like codeOSError: [Errno: 1] Operation not permitted: '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/share'/code/li liApple installs outdated versions of some packages in code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python//code (e.g., six). On previous versions of OS X, when you installed a package that needed a newer version of one of these, codesudo pip/code would silently remove the old version from the code/System//code folder and install a newer version in code/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/code. This was also a bad idea, and is no longer possible with SIP. But now pip will crash with an error message while trying to remove the old package. That message is also codeOSError: [Errno: 1]/code, but it comes after a message like codeUninstalling six-1.4.1:/code. See, e.g., https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165 ./li liThe Apple version of Python adds several directories under code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7//code to the python search path emabove/em the standard user-accessible package installation locations. So if you install a newer version of a package elsewhere (e.g., codesudo -H pip install --ignore-installed six/code), you will get a message that the installation succeeded, but then when you run python you will get the older version from code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python//code. This also makes it impossible to use new packages that have the same name as modules from the standard library./li /ol  You can work around these issues, but the method depends on your answers to three questions.  ol listrongDo you want to continue using the Mac OS X version of Python or install your own?/strong Installing your own is the safest option, and can be done via the official Python installer, Homebrew or Anaconda. This is also what Apple recommends, as pointed out by @Sacrilicious. If you install your own version of Python, you should probably uninstall anything currently installed in code/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/code and any scripts that were installed in code/usr/local/bin/code for those packages (including pip). Otherwise you will have the annoying experience of some scripts accessing the system-installed version of Python and some accessing your own installation./li /ol  If you want to stick with the system-installed Python, then you have to make two more decisions:  ol start="2" listrongDo you want to install packages for all users, or just for yourself?/strong Installing for all users ensures that every program that uses Python (including possibly administrative scripts) will have access to all the packages you install. However, there's a distant chance that it will interfere with El Capitan's own use of Python. (I would hope that Apple uses codepython -S/code to ensure they always get the packages they expect, but I have no way to test this.) Installing just for your own user account eliminates the possibility of interfering with the system Python installation. Note: if you are going to switch from system-wide installation to user-only, you should probably take this chance to uninstall anything currently installed in code/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/code and related scripts in code/usr/local/bin/code./li listrongDo you want to hide the extra packages that are installed with the OS X version of Python/strong (under code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python//code), or keep them in the search path? I recommend hiding them, so that the newest versions of these packages will automatically be installed in user-accessible locations when needed. If you don't hide this directory, then you will occasionally get messages that pip was unable to remove an existing package in order to upgrade it to a later version (needed by a different package you are installing). In that case, you will need to run codepip install --ignore-installed &lt;package&gt;/code, which will install the newer version and hide the system-installed version. However, if you hide the whole code/System/.../Extras/.../code directory, you will lose access to some Apple packages that are not available via pip, i.e., CoreGraphics and bonjour. (If you need these, you may be able to get access by symlinking them into your site-packages directory.)/li /ol  Now, here are the workarounds. These would be good practice on all versions of OS X, to avoid accidentally replacing or removing Python packages used by the operating system; however they are essential if you want to use user-installed packages with the Apple-supplied version of Python on OS X El Capitan (10.11).  h1Install pip/h1  You probably did this already, but if not, you can use the following command to install pip strongfor all users/strong:  precodesudo -H easy_install pip # pip script will be installed in /usr/local/bin /code/pre  Or use this command to install pip strongfor your own user account only/strong:  precodeeasy_install --user pip # pip script will be installed in ~/Library/Python/2.7/bin /code/pre  h1Manage Shared File Locations/h1  strongIf you are installing packages for all users,/strong create a file called .pydistutils.cfg  with these lines (from https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/426):  precode[install] install-data=/usr/local install-headers=/usr/local /code/pre  If you usually use codesudo -H pip .../code, then you should put this file in code/var/root/code (home directory for the root user). If you usually use codesudo pip .../code, then you should put this file in your own home directory (~).  These settings will prevent pip from trying to write shared items like headers and manpages under code/Library/System/code. (The command at the top of this answer is a quicker version of the same thing.) These settings are needed because darwin-specific code in  code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/distutils/command/install.py/code fails to set these variables to root-writeable locations (although it sets other variables correctly). There is more information on this at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3177 .  strongIf you install packages for your own user account only,/strong shared items will automatically be installed under code~/Library/Python/2.7//code. But you should add the following lines to your ~/.profile so the shared items will be found when you need them:  precodeexport PATH=~/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH export MANPATH=~/Library/Python/2.7/share/man:$MANPATH /code/pre  Note: you will need to start a new shell or run these on the command line for the changes to take effect. You may also want to run codehash -r/code if you've recently removed old scripts from the path.  h1Manage Python Path/h1  You will need to ensure that the packages you install are higher in Python's search order than system-installed packages. The easiest way to do this is with code.pth/code files. This follows @Sacrilicious's suggestion elsewhere on this page, but ensures that your user site-packages directory is searched before your system-wide site-packages directory, and both are searched before the standard library and Apple's Extras directory (both under /System/...). It also omits code/System/.../Extras/code from the search path if desired.  Create a file called codefix_mac_path.pth/code, with the text below. strongIf you are installing packages for all users,/strong codefix_mac_path.pth/code should be placed in code/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/code. strongIf you are installing only for your own user,/strong codefix_mac_path.pth/code should be in ~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages. (This file can have any name you want, but it has to be placed in one or both of these locations, and it has to end with code.pth/code; also, all the text in this file has to be on one line.)  strongIf you want to hide the Apple-installed packages in code/System/.../Extras/code:/strong   First run one of the following commands to get a working copy of pip/setuptools independent from the Apple-supplied version:  precodepip install --ignore-installed --user setuptools   # your account only # or sudo -H pip install --ignore-installed setuptools  # all users /code/pre  Then put the following code in codefix_mac_path.pth/code at the location specified above:  precodeimport sys; std_paths=[p for p in sys.path if p.startswith('/System/') and not '/Extras/' in p]; sys.path=[p for p in sys.path if not p.startswith('/System/')]+std_paths /code/pre  strongIf you want to keep using the Apple-installed packages,/strong you don't need to install another copy of setuptools. Just put the following code in codefix_mac_path.pth/code at the location specified above:  precodeimport sys; std_paths=[p for p in sys.path if p.startswith('/System/')]; sys.path=[p for p in sys.path if not p.startswith('/System/')]+std_paths /code/pre  After this, you can use codepython -m site/code to make sure the path search order makes sense.  h1Install Packages/h1  After this, you should be able to install new packages using one of the following commands.  strongFor all users:/strong  precodesudo -H pip install &lt;package&gt; /code/pre  strongFor your own user:/strong  precodepip install --user &lt;package&gt; /code/pre  <answer223525> A very cool solution for this issue is using virtualenv (virtualenvwrapper), after you create a new environment for your project, you can use pip without issues, so I used virtualenvwrapper and these two lines fix the problem:  precodemkproject &lt;project_name&gt; pip install &lt;package_name&gt; /code/pre  <answer226454> Believe me, you don't really want the library to write anything at that path.  It was previously not recommended, but possible to write into code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7//code , but now it's not supported due to Apple SIP and so it's the library owner problem. The package distribution should be upgraded to work correctly with this update. Most packages were updated and install their content to code/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/code, but some packages were not updated.  For my case, it was greenlet library trying to write its code.h/code file into System Frameworks folder:  How to fix it:     codesudo -H pip install greenlet --install-option "--install-headers=/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/includes/"/code then codesudo -H pip install gevent/code  For numpy, the fix is codesudo -H pip install --ignore-installed -U numpy/code.  For other libraries, fixes vary from https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3177 to codepip install --ignore-installed six/code and codepip install --user/code (last one installs everything into /User//Library/Python/2.7/ path). See also current top answer to this post: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/210021/169157  If you type codepython -m site/code it should include codesys.path = [     ...

I also removed any applications  precodesudo rm -rf /Applications/Python\ 2.7/ /code/pre  I then downloaded the 2.7.13 installer package for Mac OS X from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and installed it.

Thoughts? <comment253439> More pythonic and sensible would be to install as `--user` or use a virtualenv. I'm just of the mind, as a sysadmin, that you install once for a system, and that the user should be able to override system. The objections to this solution may be that the system would be looking at an altered path, but there is the precedent that easy_install can write a .pth file as well. <comment253441> This is indeed SIP preventing the creation of a folder(possibly for something like a man page) as a subdirectory of `/System`; off-limits as of 10.11. We can use csrutil to temporarily disable it if we're in a pinch, although I know that might feel like it could turn into whack-a-mole, but this doesn't seem like a good reason to employ it. *Leaving* it off is… why we can't have nice things. <comment253448> I got it off all the time: `statusSystem Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).
