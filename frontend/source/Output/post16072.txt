Numbers: divide in a column <body> I have a price list:  12,560br 14,340br 11,890br ...    Is there a simple way to divide these cells by a number at once?  <answer16075> The "spreadsheet" way to do this is to do the division in another column.  Lets say your data is column A, starts a row 1 and goes to row 10 (that's codeA1:A10/code in spreadsheet reference language).  In a unused column, row 1, you could enter:  precode=A1/10 /code/pre  And the copy and paste that formula from row 2 down to rows 2 through 10 in that column. Numbers will automatically increment the codeA1/code reference in the pasted cells.  The divisor (code10/code in this case) can also be a reference if you like. Just make it a fixed reference so it doesn't automatically increment as you copy and paste. Lets say codeB1/code holds the value you want to divide everything in column codeA/code by. You'd use:  precode=A1/$B$1 /code/pre  as the formula and copy and paste. The code$/code in front of the column name and row number tell Numbers not to auto-adjust those values as you paste the formula around to different cells.  Here is an example Numbers '09 file.  Column A is databr Column B is A divided by 10br Column C is A divided by whatever value is in E2, change E2 and you'll see the values in Column C change.  <comment17546> Dear lan, can you please upload me an example file? <comment17547> @Adrian: I added an example file. I better not have just done your homework for you.
