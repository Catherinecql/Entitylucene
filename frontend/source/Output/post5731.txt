How to run Wireshark in the background without the GUI? <body> I am trying to run Wireshark on Mac OS X in the background. I installed the command line utilities, and so I am able to start Wireshark and capture packets using the command line.  The only thing I want now is to run it in the background, without the X11 icon in the Dock or seeing Wireshark's window. I believe it is possible, but can't find anything in Wireshark's docs.  Maybe another approach would be to hide the icon?  If anybody has already did this or has an idea…  <answer5732> As initially seen here:     As far as I remember TShark comes with all distributions of Wireshark. This runs from the command line. The documentation for it is here: http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html      And there's some examples on how to use it here: http://www.codealias.info/technotes/the_tshark_capture_and_filter_example_page   — David Hewitt  <answer5733> There is also a complete alternative in the form of tcpdump, which comes by default on many OSX installs. The syntax is different, but it's command-line only, and is invaluable in a smaller/command line only environment.  It must be run as root, otherwise undo codesudo/code.  <answer5734> You could run it in codescreen/code, or in a virtual X11 session (Xvfb) that is not displaying to your monitor.  <answer5750> As @VxJasonxV said you can use TCPDump and if you don't want the output show on terminal can use code&gt;&gt; filename/code to TCPDump save result on your desired file.  you can use TCPDump with many options but I think this was the best one:  precodetcpdump -n -v -S -i en1 tcp /code/pre  en1: interface that you assign IPv4  -v: produce (slightly more) verbose output   -S: Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers.  -n: Don't convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.  -i: Listen on interface.  but this save the output that was not readable by human if you want to process the output that was readable by human you must use tshark:  the command that you must use is some thing like this:  precodetshark -r ~/home/myHome/Desktop/file_name(produce by tcpdump) -R "ip.src==172.16.13.128" -T fields -e frame.number -e frame.time -e ip.id -e tcp.window_size -e tcp.analysis.ack_rtt -E header=y &gt; ~/home/myHome/Desktop/file_name.txt /code/pre  <comment5961> BTW - please don't post questions here *and* at [Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/227526/how-to-run-wireshark-on-the-background-without-the-gui).
