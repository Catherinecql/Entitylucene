Odd cputype in /bin/ls binary <body> I just started with Charlie Miller and Dino Dai Zovi's Mac Hacker's Handbook and was doing the tutorials. This includes getting to know things like 'otool'  precodeotool -f \bin\ls Fat headers fat_magic 0xcafebabe nfat_arch 2 architecture 0     cputype 16777223     cpusubtype 3     capabilities 0x80     offset 4096     size 39600     align 2^12 (4096) architecture 1     cputype 7     cpusubtype 3     capabilities 0x0     offset 45056     size 35632     align 2^12 (4096) /code/pre  I tried to find something about that first codecputype/code in /usr/include/mach/machine.h, but found nothing. Clearly I am missing something.  <answer7772> As far as I can figure out, intel FORTRAN-compiled objects use a cputype 16777223 but gcc-compiled objects use a cputype of 7  <answer7789> codecputype/code 16777223 is “x86 64” (64 bit mode); 7 is “i386” (32 bit mode). Incidentally, 16777223 == 0x1000007, so bit 24 means “64 bit”.  Looking in code/usr/include/mach/machine.h/code (pointed out by code…/mach-o/fat.h/code, which seems like a reasonable place to start), we find the following:  precode⋮ typedef integer_t       cpu_type_t; ⋮ #define CPU_ARCH_ABI64  0x01000000              /* 64 bit ABI */ ⋮ #define CPU_TYPE_X86            ((cpu_type_t) 7) #define CPU_TYPE_I386           CPU_TYPE_X86            /* compatibility */ #define CPU_TYPE_X86_64         (CPU_TYPE_X86 | CPU_ARCH_ABI64) ⋮ #define CPU_TYPE_POWERPC                ((cpu_type_t) 18) #define CPU_TYPE_POWERPC64              (CPU_TYPE_POWERPC | CPU_ARCH_ABI64) ⋮ /code/pre  Of course, you can also just add the code-v/code option to your codeotool/code command to have it show the symbolic values:  precode% otool -vf /bin/ls Fat headers fat_magic FAT_MAGIC nfat_arch 2 architecture x86_64     cputype CPU_TYPE_X86_64     cpusubtype CPU_SUBTYPE_X86_64_ALL     capabilities CPU_SUBTYPE_LIB64     offset 4096     size 39600     align 2^12 (4096) architecture i386     cputype CPU_TYPE_I386     cpusubtype CPU_SUBTYPE_I386_ALL     capabilities 0x0     offset 45056     size 35632     align 2^12 (4096) /code/pre  <comment8482> Thanks a lot. I completely overlooked the definitons with the hex-values when looking at the file. Thanks again for the hint about the argument :-)
