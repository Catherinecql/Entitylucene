How can I reset my iPhone 1 without using the (broken) power button? <body> The power button on my first-gen iPhone is broken. I remember last time I came across this problem I found a utility (for windows) which caused the phone sto reset/s to enter restore mode (the one with the yellow alert symbol), but I can't for the life of me find it again. Does anyone know what it is?  Thanks for any help, Wyatt.  <answer5240> I don't know about the yellow alert symbol, but a quick google for "iphone recovery mode utility" revealed RecBoot, which looks like exactly what you're looking for.  Also, Settings  General  Reset  Reset Network Settings should restart your iPhone.
