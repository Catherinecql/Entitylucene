why do iPhoto, Word, and Finder open when I restart Lion? <body> I'm using Lion (10.7.2).  I close all applications and restart the Mac.  When it starts up again, it opens windows for iPhoto, Word (to a blank doc), Address Book, and a Finder window.  None of these application are in my "Login Items" for my account.  How do I get Lion to start clean instead of opening all these apps?  Rob  <answer31225> Back up your system before trying this, in case it messes anything up, but I'd recommend this procedure:  In the Finder, press kbd⌘/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdG/kbd for "Go to the folder:" then type code~/Library/Saved Application State//code. Delete all the folders in Saved Application State, then press Command-I to Get File Info. In the Get File Info window, check the "locked" box. This should keep applications from restoring their state.  <answer31568> FYI, I reinstalled Lion and the problem is now gone.
