Is it possible to upgrade my MacBook Pro RAM and Hard Drive? <body> I bought Macbook Pro 15 inch laptop last year with 4 GB RAM and 300 GB Hard disk, Now I feel like upgrading its RAM to 8 GB and 1 TB hard disk. I want to know is it possible to do that or not.  precodeMy system configuration is as follows:     Hardware Overview:       Model Name:   MacBook Pro       Model Identifier: MacBookPro5,1       Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo       Processor Speed:  2.66 GHz       Number Of Processors: 1       Total Number Of Cores:    2       L2 Cache: 6 MB       Memory:   4 GB       Bus Speed:    1.07 GHz       Boot ROM Version: MBP51.007E.B05       SMC Version (system): 1.41f2       Serial Number (system):   W89123XF71A       Hardware UUID:    CF78C5AA-188D-538A-8250-F21B474DEF9E       Sudden Motion Sensor:       State:    Enabled  Memory Slots:   ECC:  Disabled BANK 0/DIMM0:   Size: 2 GB   Type: DDR3   Speed:    1067 MHz   Status:   OK   Manufacturer: 0x80CE   Part Number:  0x4D34373142353637334448312D4346382020   Serial Number:    0x446323C2  BANK 0/DIMM1:    Size: 2 GB   Type: DDR3   Speed:    1067 MHz   Status:   OK   Manufacturer: 0x80CE   Part Number:  0x4D34373142353637334448312D4346382020   Serial Number:    0x44632496 /code/pre  By looking up the above config, what is the max amount of RAM and hard drive can I upgrade to? Thanks.  <answer27942> Regarding upgrades, as per this answer to a related question, OWC is a reliable resource. Here are their pages on memory - it looks like 16 GB (2 x 8GB modules) will be your max RAM.  Similarly, here's info on hard-drive upgrades. It looks like 1TB is going to be your maximum, though as far as I know that's merely a limitation to what sizes are available in the 2.5-inch form factor that the MacBook Pro (and almost every other laptop in existence) uses. If and when larger 2.5-inch drives are released, an MBP should be able to use one.
