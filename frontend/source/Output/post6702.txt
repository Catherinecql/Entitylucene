Uploading pictures on iPhone to Facebook application doesn't work <body> Trying to upload picture from my iPhone to Facebook.  In Facebook app, when I choose a picture and select 'Upload' I should see progress bar as picture uploads.  Instead when I press 'Upload' the upload screen disappears and picture is not uploaded.   I tried closing the app and restarting it again, it still doesn't work. I reinstalled the application and then it will let me upload couple of pictures until it will start failing again.   I have iPhone 4 running OS 4.2.1  <answer6714> Go to Settings-general-Location Services, switch facebook to "ON" and try again. Hope this helps!  <comment7231> although i'm not sure why, this fixes it. <comment53259> I tried but it didn't work for me.
