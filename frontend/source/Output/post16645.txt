Cloned and changed HDD; now almost every program crashes on startup <body> As the title suggests I cloned my mac hdd using CCC and bootcamped and restored win 7 on the bootcamp partition.  It would seem that everything worked out as planned but the first thing I noticed was that chrome wouldn't launch. It would crash instantly. So I re-installed it which did nothing. I then proceeded to remove the application support folder for Chrome and then re-installed. Nope.   I then noticed that NONE of my applications that aren't from Apple (apart from Unity3d which actually runs) will start. They all "quit unexpectedly". I have tried to repair dependencies and I have controlled the integrity of my drive. It repaired a bunch of dependencies but couldn't find anything wrong with the disk. I have a hunch it has something to do with when I restored the windows 7 installation but I can't be sure of that.  Anyone have the slightest idea what's going on? How would I fix this without having to wipe the mac installation?  Thanks for reading!  strongEdit/strong After having a look in system.log I can see something that might indicate that something is bad with the partitioning. Every crash looks like this:  precodeJun 28 14:47:53 MacBook-Pro ReportCrash[3461]: [CrashReport _extractBinaryImageInfoUsingSymbolicator] caught exception: Called memoryAtAddress: 0xa0a5b794, which is in an unmappable portion of [0x0 -&gt; 0xffffffffffffffff] in PID# 3457.

(???) to /Users/phil/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Unitron_2011-06-28-144753_MacBook-Pro.crash /code/pre  <answer16662> strike[ ... ]/strike  Disregard my previous answer. I looked at the crash log again, and did a few searches and tracked down the following (strongsource/strong):     In a normal Crash Report there is an appended list of apps and utilities (the Binaries), which this crash report hasn't managed to capture...      That crash is happening very early in the launch and the Report is incomplete. The app is trying to use areas of unmapped memory and this can be caused by three factors: The Application or the Data (Your Library) and in rare circumstances, the OS.      So lets start by eliminating some possibilities:   Edited for your situation:     Create a new account (System Preferences - Accounts), install Chrome, and see if you can launch it. If the application launches successfully, then it's likely your 3P apps are okay and the problem is something in the main account.   <answer16663> Restoring any data to another partition won't affect your mac partition unless you have a serious hardware error and no amount of software steps will address that. Let's set aside errors with HD or RAM or MLB for a moment and make sure things are working.  Run a safe boot, then reboot back to OS X and dig a bit at the crashes.  Specifically, the three lines in each crash report will let you know why the system crashed each third party app.  preException Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)  Exception Codes: 0x000000000000000d, 0x0000000000000000  Crashed Thread: 0 Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread/pre  Once you get a feel for whether it's the same exception type, you can dig deeper. Like I commented - you could try repairing permissions or re-installing the latest OS X update you are comfortable (10.6.8 is the latest) but whatever you had before should rebuild any shared library code and try again with the 3PP apps.  Good luck - you will certainly learn something about how OS X apps load in this ordeal.  <answer16730> This is a strongSolution/strong and not an answer. I wiped the disk clean and inserted it totally fresh into the mac. I installed Mac OS X from my original installation dvd and just proceeded as usual with that. In the installation procedure I was asked to copy stuff from an old mac and I chose the alternative to copy from another volume on the mac. Since I've got this kit to plug in any internal drive as a usb-drive I just plugged in the original still unscathed disk where everything was like I left it after I copied it. This restored all the programs and what not and they worked as usual after this procedure.   I convinced myself to just start over with a fresh bootcamp installation and bring over whatever I need from the old disk when I need it. Not the best solution but it can be good to know that the mac's function to "restore" from an old mac actually repaired what was broken. My mac os is exactly like I left it on the other disk.   Since the days of XP, I'm pretty used to starting fresh with windows so I'm actually looking forward to it a little bit..  <comment18187> If you open console app - is there anything useful or worth posting from /private/var/log/system.log - I would try to launch one 3PP app several times, and maybe repeat with a second app that is a bit different (don't run two Office apps or two adobe apps - make them from different vendors) <comment18188> I added a crashdump. What do you mean by '3pp'? <comment18194> Sorry - third party product. 3PP is software not made by apple. Would you also consider looking at four or five crashes - the individual report that lives in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter - the three lines that mention " Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: 0x000000000000000d, 0x0000000000000000 Crashed Thread:  0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread" are most interesting. If all of them have the same cause or not... <comment18212> Answer edited. Disregard previous answer. <comment18215> Now that's a great answer! Awesome find - I'm really curious to see the crashes in this case.
