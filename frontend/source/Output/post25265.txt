I press pause, the video will stop playing after 10 seconds/li liIf a video has closed captions, will show a subtitle every 3 sentences (slow)/li liNo problems at all with Music/podcast/books/apps/li /ul  I tried to remove all videos but even with no videos, the video app continues to crash This behaviour started from day one, not happened suddenly  What i can do?  <answer62840> Updating to iOS 5.1.1 fixed the problem
