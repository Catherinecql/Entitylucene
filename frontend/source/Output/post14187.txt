marking iCal events as private and sync it with exchange, windows mobile <body> I am using Outlook/Exchange at work and iCal at home. I have one Outlook/iCal calender for all my appointments (both home and work). I sync between outlook and iCal using my windows mobile 6.5 phone, currently testing The Missing Sync.   I need my colleagues to see my private events in the (shared) outlook/exchange calender at work. They have to see when I am not available but for private events they must not see WHY I am not available and what kind of private event that is.   How can I   ol licreate a private event in iCal that when synched with my phone an later also with outlook is still marked as private,/li lisee in iCal whether something is marked as private?/li /ol  Has anyone figured out a workflow for this scenario? Maybe using something else than The Missing Sync or some plugin (preferably without pushing anything to the cloud)?  <answer35923> This is a limitation of the iPhone. Events can be marked a private from OS X only.
