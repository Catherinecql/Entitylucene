Preview problem on "iPhoto imported" clips in iMovie <body> I've a strange problem with iMovie : I can preview movie clips that I've directly imported into iMovie, but the ones that have been imported from my camera by iPhoto have a problem : the displayed preview when I do a "mouse-over" is showing another movie clip (always the same, for every movie clip)  Is there a way to ask iPhoto or iMovie to "rebuild" this previews ?  EDIT : Is there a way to rebuild the cache of iPhoto ?  <answer5106> Hold cmd+opt while launching iPhoto.  Good luck! :-)
