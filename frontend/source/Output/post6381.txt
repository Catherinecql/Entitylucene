Missing advanced network settings for iPhone USB/Bluetooth tethering <body> My iPhone is tethered to my Mac laptop via Bluetooth or USB.    I want to set up a proxy on my Mac for use with the iPhone network interface, but unfortunately in Mac OS X 10.6, under System Preferences - Network, the iPhone Bluetooth and iPhone USB network interfaces lack the standard options under the Advanced… tab. These Advanced… options are available in other interfaces (e.g., Airport, Ethernet, etc.).  I want to use the polipo caching proxy for tethered browsing, but I am unable to define an HTTP Proxy in the GUI, since these options are missing.  The prefpane windows for my tethered iPhone's network interfaces (Bluetooth &amp; USB)  is missing the normal options for network interfaces.  Does anyone know a command line workaround for setting up an HTTP proxy, or some way of modifying the prefpane settings for the iPhone network interfaces?  <answer35678> You can use the codenetworksetup/code command. For example:  precodesudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy "iPhone USB" localhost 8888 /code/pre  Take a look at http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/networksetup.8.html  <comment236534> Here are some more examples for google to index: `sudo networksetup -setwebproxy "Bluetooth PAN" localhost 8118` and `sudo networksetup -setsecurewebproxy "Bluetooth PAN" localhost 8118`
