CMOS Battery in MacBook Pro 2007 <body> CMOS battery in my MacBook Pro (2007, pre-unibody) has died recently.  I am looking for a replacement, although all I could find so far was only used batteries off ebay.  It says following on the battery's shrink wrap:   precodeCR2025/USTC PW3+3V 7 8 21 /code/pre  Under the shrink wrap it says:  precodePanasonic CR2025 3V Made in Malasya /code/pre  So I am wondering if I could simply take a good quality CR2025 battery and use it instead of buying a used one? Or is this some super-secret version of CR2025 only Apple managed to get its hands on and I'd better off getting a used one, although straight of a MacBook Pro?  <answer31746> Any standard CR 2025 will do the trick.
