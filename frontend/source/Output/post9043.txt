Why do some of my programs get terminated when the screensaver runs? <body> I have Mac with OS X 10.6.6 running.  When the screensaver gets started and runs for a few minutes (10 or 15?) Thunderbind, Firefox and a few other programs gets terminated because OS X seems to want to log me out. This is very annoying as I have to restart all of these programs again and again.  The interesting part is I have another Mac also running OS X 10.6.6 where I do not experience this behaviour.  Any help is appreciated  Robert  <answer9050> Go to the Security pane of System Preferences.  Uncheck the box that says, "Log out after [##] minutes of inactivity."
