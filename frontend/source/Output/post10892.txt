Task switching on iOS 4.3.1? <body> I just upgraded my iPod (4gen) from iOS 4.3 to 4.3.1.  Pressing the button twice now no longer brings up the app switcher.  Is there some setting I need to change to bring this back?  I didn't see anything in the release notes about removing or disabling this feature.  <answer10893> I played around with it for a few minutes, and eventually it went back to the old mode where task switching works.  I have no idea why, and I didn't change any setting.  It's not just the speed: I've never had trouble getting task switching to work, and for the first 10 minutes after upgrading, it didn't work no matter how fast I clicked it.  It would zip over to the useless search screen and back really fast.  <comment11401> Works on my 3rd gen, for what it's worth.  It's always been a bit finicky timing-wise for me, though.
