Does PlainText transmit data securely? <body> Does the iPhone App PlainText transmit data securely (i.e. does it use SSL?), or it there a risk of my data being read by third parties when I sync with dropbox?  <answer8216> On dropbox's web site, it says: All transmission of file data and metadata occurs over an encrypted channel (SSL).  Furthermore, data send over the 3G cellular connection uses a 3G over-the-air encryption protocol (which will likely be unencrypted for forwarding to the internet past the cell tower).  <answer8358> I emailed the company, and according to them:     PlainText syncs using the provided Dropbox SDK, which specifies   SSL/https   ... meaning that everything is transmitted securely.  <comment8936> Dropbox may be encrypting the data over SSL - don't know if PlainText talks directly to the Dropbox site or proxies the connection through some over place first as PlainText is not the same developer as Dropbox. <comment8938> @Rex: that is exactly the same concern I have.
