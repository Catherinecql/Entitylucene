Command line: Sending a zip file via e-mail <body> I am using "mail" to send e-mails from command line on my OSX 10.6  the "&lt; filename" however doesn't work quite well, as I don't really see the file as "attachment" on any standard e-mail client. Is there any solution for this with the standard tools that come pre-installed with OSX 10.6?  <answer15196> The easiest solution to your current situation is to use uuencode to encode the file format and mail it. Try this line:  codeuuencode /your/file.zip file.zip | mail -s subject recipient@mail/code  Another possibility is to use perl/python scripts to do that job (maybe better), but the above solution just works(tm)  <answer15197> The quick and dirty way to send an attachment is to uuencode the file and mail it.  pre uuencode report.pdf report.pdf | mail -s "Here is the report" bossman@company.com /pre  If you want to do it easily and build a proper MIME encoded message, you could install mutt, and use the -a flag to attach your message.   If you don't want to install anything else, you could build your own MIME message by hand, or use the perl MIME::Entity module to help you:  pre #!/usr/bin/perl use MIME::Entity;  $message = MIME::Entity-build(   Type    = "multipart/mixed",   From    = "me\@company.com",   To      = "bossman\@company.com",   Subject = "Report attached" );  $message-attach(Data="Here is the report, as promised.");  $message-attach(   Path     = "./report.pdf",   Type     = "application/pdf",   Encoding = "base64");  open MAIL, "| /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -oi"; $message-print(\*MAIL); close MAIL; /pre
