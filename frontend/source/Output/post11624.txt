How do I save all MMS (with text, images & videos) from a non-jailbroken iPhone? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Extract SMS messages off iPhone 4       I've got a non jailbroken iPhone 3GS (iOS 4.2.1) with a lot (hundreds) of text messages and MMS. A good number of theses MMS contain photos.  Is there a way to save all this data at once on my computer (PC with Win7) without having to manually copy/paste each message content?
