No New Mail Sound 10.6.7 <body> This issue has been going on and off for years.  I still don't consistently get the new mail sound when new mail arrives.  Sometimes it happens, most of the time, never.  10.6.7  <answer12146> Since you mention this has been going on for years, this is likely related to a longstanding bug in Mail.app and fetching mail with IMAP. Try the instructions here and see if it helps:     In Mail, open Preferences and go to   Accounts » Advanced in all your mail   accounts and turn off the Use IDLE   command feature. Next, go to the   General section of Preferences, and   set Check for New Mail to Every minute   -- you can set a longer interval if you want, so long as you don't set it   to Manual.      Now your mail alerts should play for   every incoming message, but you will   see your messages up to one minute   later than you would with the IDLE   mechanism.   <answer43712> I changed back and forth from classic view and the sound reappeared. Open Mail, select preferences, select view (check or uncheck to make it the opposite of what you have there). Close Mail...open and the sound returns.   You can then switch it back to the view you liked.  <comment12767> it's a shame apple doesn't recognize this issue.  but thanks for the help, it works. <comment12775> You can always file a bug report: http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html
