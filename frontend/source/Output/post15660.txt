Drivers for Logitech QuickCam Orbit AF: Any third-party options? <body> I have a lovely USB webcam, namely the QuickCam® Orbit AF. It's the type of webcam one often sees at Customs checkpoints at airports around the world. It also looks a bit like HAL.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7BxgV.png" alt="HAL"  The problem is that it's only fully supported under Windows. I'm after a third-party solution because:     Your Logitech camera must be UVC   (Universal Video Class) compliant in   order to be used on your Mac OS 10.4.9   and above computer. emThese standard UVC   drivers are provided by the Operating   System and will only provide minimal   camera support./em      [...]      strongNOTE:/strong With the exception of the   QuickCam Vision Pro for Mac and the HD   Pro Webcam C910, all other UVC cameras   are not officially supported on the   Mac and some features or application   support may not work.   I wonder if someone can point towards a third-party driver that'll make this thing run like it does on Windows?  <answer15716> First thing I'd try would be Macam. Your camera is listed as 'it depends (UVC)' on the supported list, which suggests it's getting most of its functionality from the built-in UVC driver anyway. But it's free, so you've nothing to lose by trying it...  EDIT: Scratch that. The details page for your camera says it doesn't yet work with Macam at all, only with the built-in UVC driver.  <answer187012> Somebody finally made a little app that supports the pan and tilt movement for the Logitech quickcam orbit sphere AF for OS X  Zoom is not (yet) supported  https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/orbit-command/id666312129?l=en&amp;mt=12  Costs you €10  <comment17099> Hey, thanks for trying anyway Calum. I appreciate it.
