Monitoring and disconnecting users from an AirPort Extreme <body> Does anyone know a simple way to monitor who is connected to an AirPort Extreme, see the bandwidth they are using, and the ability to disconnect them or throttle their bandwidth usage?  I know for disconnecting two options would be 1. updating wifi password and restarting the AirPort Extreme 2. setting a limit by MAC address  but I am looking for something that wouldn't involve restarting the AirPort each time.  <answer6246> Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a native way to do this.  With regard to detailed bandwidth monitoring, the Airport Extreme supports SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) so if you want to put in a bit of effort, you could set up Cacti http://www.cacti.net/ and point that at the base station.  As far as remote disconnection of users, there is no way that I know of short of the two options you mentioned.  <comment6164> It's quite easy to spoof MAC addresses, so that isn't even bullet proof. <comment6507> If you're using OS X server, you can use RADIUS to limit access by MAC address.
