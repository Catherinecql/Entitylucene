How to undo SetFile -a V? <body> I used SetFile -a V "/Volumes/Backup di Time Machine"/ to get rid off the time machine's icon on the desktop but it seems that I don't see it in the finder too and Time Machine stops working, it can't find the drive! So how to undo this? Thanks  P.S. stay away from this devil trick ;)  <answer17492> I found the solution. Just type the attribute V lowercase and restart the Finder!:)   <comment19077> I found the solution. Just type the attribute `V` lowercase and restart the Finder!:)
