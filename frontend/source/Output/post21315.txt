Key Remapping on Logitech K750 <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Permanently swapping option and command keys on a non-Apple keyboard       I have a Logitec K750 and it has the left Alt key closer to the space bar than the Windows Key (to be used as Command Key).  How can I remap the keys on JUST my Logitech keyboard and NOT on my built-in MacBook keyboard so that the Left Alt key functions like the Command Key, and the Left Command Key functions like the Left Alt key?  Is there a way to do this without having any apps running in the background, like some kind of key-map file I can edit rather than using a tool to do it? I'm a real resource-conscious user and don't want anything running in the background.  Thanks!  <answer21327> Possible duplicate of this answered question.  The solution seems to remap all keyboards with KeyRemap4MacBook and then remap just the internal keyboard with standard keyboard preferences pane. (not tested by myself)
