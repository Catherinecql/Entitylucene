Why is Dropbox erring on startup? <body> I opened up Dropbox and received this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziSIH.png" alt="Dropbox Error"    I am on an Intel i5 MBP running 10.6.8. Dropbox is version 1.1.45.

Judging by the screenshot it is not your case so there is either a problem with zlib on your system or with permissions. Then either Disk Utility or booting from install disk and repair user permissions might help.  If nothing above try to remove Dropbox with a cleaner app and install anew.  <comment34254> Did you "Open Console"? <comment34269> I concur with @patrix: the Console output would be more than helpful to diagnose this. <comment34280> Also, have you tried manually updating to the latest stable build? <comment34319> @patrix Thanks for adding the log file. I couldn't figure out how to format it right. <comment34336> Have you exhausted the dropbox support website? They will know the best how to react to errors in their program. List a little more in your question - what you tried / what versions of DropBox and your OS for sure. Perhaps if you are on Intel/PPC might be relevant. <comment34419> I re-installed Dropbox. Don't know what happened, but thanks for your quick answer!
