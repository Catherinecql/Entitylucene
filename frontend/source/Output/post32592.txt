AppleFontSmoothing Has No Effect On My ViewSonic VX2450 <body> I've followed the advice in these questions and am not having any luck.  No matter what I try, the fonts are rendered so poorly on the external monitor.  My environment -  ul liMacBook Pro 15" Early 2011/li liViewSonic VX2450 External Monitor using DVI./li /ul  I've tried values for "X" (0,1,2 and 3) for this command without effect --  precodedefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int X /code/pre  I've also tried each of these values along with various combinations of values for "Use LCD font smoothing when available" and "Turn off text smoothing for fonts sizes X and smaller" in System Preferences  General.  All without any luck.  Can anyone offer me some advice?  Thanks!  <answer33953> Are you sure it's font smoothing that is to blame? I had a similar issue that was caused by trying to use a resolution which was available in my displays preference but higher than my monitor supported.   Even though your monitor is rated for 1080p try a resolution with less than 1080px height. There's a possibility that you won't be able to get full 1080p through DVI (will explain further if the lower resolution solves it).  Also note that the same thing can happen when you use non-native resolutions that require scaling, not just larger ones.  <answer75235> A couple things to consider:  ul liDo you see a difference with the various AppleFontSmoothing settings on your main display?/li liAre you seeing this in all apps, or just one or two?  ul liSome programs render fonts independently of the OS, so changing the global font smoothing won't make a difference in them/li /ul/li liWhat is the physical connection between the MacBook and the Viewsonic? ol limDP to VGA adapter?/li limDP to DVI adapter?/li limDP to HDMI adapter? ul liAnalog signals on VGA might not support the resolution/li liMake sure any OSD controls for the port you're using have the correct settings/li /ul/li /ol/li liHow have you configured the Viewsonic, relative to your MacBook's main panel? ol liMirroring the internal display ul liSelect a resolution for your main display that is an even factor of your Viewsonic's native resolution/li /ul/li liSet as its own independent display ul liChoose the Viewsonic's native resolution/li /ul/li /ol/li /ul  Hope one of these leads you down a path that ends in a pretty picture.
