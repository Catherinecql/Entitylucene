Password dialog appears for password-less SSH private key <body> I installed my SSH private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. There is emno passphrase/em associated with the key, however, whenever I connect to an SSH server, a dialog pops up and asks me to enter my password to access the id_rsa file.  If I cancel the dialog or enter an empty passphrase and click OK, the Terminal prompts me for a passphrase.  I have verified that the key is valid and does not require a password by connecting with the same key via other machines.  Something odd about my particular set-up is causing the problem but I can't figure it out. I'm currently running OSX 10.7.1 but the same problem was occurring with OSX 10.6.8  <answer32611> I had this same problem.  However, when a generated a new password-less private key, using the following command:  precodessh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa -f id_rsa -P "" /code/pre  I no longer saw the password prompt.  Additionally, ssh-add failed to add the old key, but added the new one as expected.  I generated the old key on Leopard in 2009, using what ever version of OpenSSL I had grabbed, built and installed back then (that Mac died, so I can't log in and check what I was running).  Something about that key was incompatible with Lion's native SSL libraries.  I backed up my old key, so if anyone wants to suggest some checks, to identify the key's specific properties, let me what to check and I'll report back.  Another clue - I noticed that my old id_rsa.pub file had extended attributes.  i.e. it's permissions flags looked like this r--------@ instead of r--------  precodexattr -l id_rsa.pub.old /code/pre  returned:  precodecom.macromates.caret: {     column = 0;     line = 1; } /code/pre  cruft left over from TextMate.  I don't know if removing it would have fixed the issue without my having to replace the key. I think it's unlikely.    In case you (future reader) are seeing the same thing, you can remove the extended attribute as follows:  precode xattr -d com.macromates.caret id_rsa.pub.old /code/pre  You can stop TextMate from adding them by first exiting TextMate and then issuing this command:   precodedefaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDocumentDisableFSMetaData 1 /code/pre  <answer204280> For me, I have found that some stray text or an imperfection in the keyfile can cause this prompt. The latest for me was this:  code  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ... -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- /code  Notice the extra space there. That was causing this bizarre password prompt to appear on this passwordless key.  <comment28077> Did you try selecting "Remember password in my keychain" in the authentication dialog? <comment28922> Yes, I've tried selecting the remember checkbox. I've also tried using a blank password and clicking OK and also simply canceling the dialog box. But all of this seems beside the point: It should **NOT** be prompting me for a passphrase because there is no passphrase associated with the key. It is a private, passwordless key. <comment28959> Ah, I see. Please file a bug report at http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/ to make sure Apple knows this is a problem for you. <comment106977> My original file didn't have any extended properties, but it was generated by putty-keygen on Windows; when I recreated a new private/public key pair without a passphrase, it worked like a charm. <comment187356> In my case it turned out that I _had_ put a passphrase on the private key.  It was so long ago that I had forgotten it was still in the keychain.  When I moved the files to a new machine, I couldn't figure out why they didn't work.  Luckily I still had the passphrase in my notes.  D'oh!
