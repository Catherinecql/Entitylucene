Media controls in chrome for Mac <body> Now Spotify is useless I've shifted Grooveshark, however there's a distinct lack of being able to use the media controls at the top of the keyboard to control it.  Is there an extension or (non-web)app to enable this? Grooveshark responds to space, ctrl+arrow, for play and skip to next/prev track, but only when focused. I'd like to remap these to the media controls, and if possible not have to have focus on Chrome and the grooveshark tab.  <answer12131> If you use the desktop client for OS X grooveshark says they have enabled keyboard shortcuts:      http://wanderr.com/jay/keyboard-shortcuts-for-grooveshark-desktop/2010/06/05/   But if you want to use the web player, it looks like it might be a lost unless you use Firefox for which there is an addon named keySharky:      https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keysharky/
