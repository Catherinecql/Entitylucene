How can I resize a window that doesn't have the grabbing part on the bottom right? <body> I have Hulu desktop running and I want to make the window smaller, there are no lines which are usually present on windows for resizing on the bottom right corner, though. On windows I could right-click the title bar and choose size for these kind of windows, is there any way to do something similar on a Mac?  I tried pressing the green button on the top left, but that doesn't do anything.  <answer475> I use MercuryMover for move or resize windows with keyboard.  MercuryMover is a utility designed to help you keep your hands on the keyboard. Installed as a System Preferences panel, MercuryMover makes it possible to move and resize windows using just the keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hPJXS.png" alt="alt text"  <answer481> Hard to find free softwares for this, I only found a donationware :  ul liWindow Wrangler/li /ul  Otherwise, you can have paid solutions :  ul liCinch, which a nice and useful windows manager./li liMondoMouse/li liZooom/2/li /ul
