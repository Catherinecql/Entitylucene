Can any apps print from the iPhone? <body> Can any apps print from the iPhone? Preferably via WiFi...and to an Epson PX710 all-in-one in my case.  <answer1917> Print n Share perhaps.  There also are a bunch of other apps for this in the app store.   <answer1918> If you want to print pictures and photos, you can use Epson iPrint (there are similar apps from other printer manufacturers, e.g. Canon iEPP, HP iPrint Photo 2.0, Kodak Pic Flick or Lexmark LexPrint). For printing PDFs or other documents, the already mentioned "print n share", "Print Bureau" (both from eurosmartz) or Air Sharing Pro from Avatron could be useful.  <answer2275>    strongApple’s AirPrint Wireless Printing for iPad, iPhone &amp; iPod touch Coming   to Users in November/strong      CUPERTINO, California—September 15,   2010—Apple® today announced that it is   releasing a beta version of its   AirPrint wireless printing for iPad™,   iPhone® and iPod touch® to members of   Apple’s iOS developer program today,   and that AirPrint will be included in   the free iOS 4.2 software update in   November.
