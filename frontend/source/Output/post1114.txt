iPod 2nd Gen Replacement digitizer not working <body> So I just ordered a new digitizer and middle frame for my 2nd Gen iPod Touch, wired everything up, and the digitizer is not recognizing any finger swipes.  I have not snapped the frame into place yet as I want to make sure I don't have to tear this thing apart again.  The video's I've watched show that the digitizer "should" work when not snapped in.  Is there anything I should be looking for before marking this new digitizer as defective?  <answer1176> If you're sure that it's cable is in correctly and it doesn't come up after a hard reboot (hold power button, slide to off, turn on again) - chances are it is defective or not the the right type. Not sure about ipods but the digitizers on iphone generations are listed as not compatible on parts websites!  <answer2357> Ended up ordering a new digitizer :-(  <comment915> thanks for the edit.  I'm not used to not being able to create my own tags. <comment94506> Did it work ok? <comment94507> yes, the first digitizer had a micro tear in the ribbon cable.
