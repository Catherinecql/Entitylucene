How to sync music using other softs rather then iTunes <body> I use Ubuntu and every time I need to transfer music to my iPod Touch I need to start VirtualBox where I have WindowsXP especially installed for this occasion.  Is there any easier way to transfer/sync/delete musics in my iPod Touch right from Ubuntu?   Thanks  <answer11953> There are a bunch of Linux applications that do it.  This question on Ask Unbuntu might help: Applications To Replace iTunes For iPod Synchronization.  Around my house, my wife and daughter use RhythmBox for loading up their iPod Touches (2G &amp; 3G).
