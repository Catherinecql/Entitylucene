Starting Keynote presenter mode without an external monitor <body> Before a talk, I'd like to try the presenter mode for Keynote - to get familiar with it - on my Macbook Pro, without an alternate display being attached.  Is this possible? How?  <answer29880> I don't have my adapter handy to test this, but you might be able to just plug the adapter in and have the MBP think it has a second monitor.  This definitely doesn't work with the mini display port to DVI adapter, but I seem to recall that it worked with a mini DVI to VGA adapter (or was it the DVI to VGA adapter?).  <answer29885> Keynote has this functionality built-in. In Keynote, go to the codePlay/code menu, then choose codeRehearse Slideshow./code You'll then have presenter mode on your single screen.
