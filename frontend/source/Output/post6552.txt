Why does Google Chrome mount and unmount a volume every few hours? <body> I'm assuming it's part of the 'check for updates' process, but does anyone know how this is controlled and what it's mounting and unmounting?    I first discovered this behavior after updating Growl, and I ran HardwareGrowler to see what it did (it was a slow afternoon) and it's kind of neat to see what hardware is connected at any given time, and watching what happens when I plug in various USB peripherals, etc.  I know, I have a severely deficient view of entertainment.  After amusing myself with this for about 5-10 minutes, I returned to my work.  Some time after this, I spotted out of the corner of my eye a Growl message that said 'Volume Mounted Google 8.0.0 (something)'  And just as quickly 'Volume Unmounted Google 8.0.0 (something)'.  I didn't get time for screen shots, it appeared and disappeared within seconds.   Has anyone else noticed this and is the explanation for it posted somewhere online?  Apparently there's some helper process that's running that's doing it, but I don't see anything in Activity Monitor with Google or Chrome in the name.  I'm not a process-killing weenie, I'm just curious about this behavior I'd never noticed before.  <answer6556> Apparently there is a Google Software Update process that is queued to run periodically, which is why it's not always there. (I couldn't grab a screenshot of it, it was too sneaky). It's not just for Chrome, but for Google Earth and Picasa too. It was a bit of a breadcrumb hunt finding info about it.     I think the Google updater isn't a proces that runs all the time, but a launchd job that runs when you boot and every so often after that. Google com.google.keystone.user.agent and you'll find a number of explanations of what they've done (and how to get rid of it if you want).       charlie  (Apple Discussions)   From Google's Help Page:     Google Software Update is a background application for the Mac OS that helps ensure that you always have the most up-to-date, stable, and secure versions of the Google software you have installed. Google Software Update may run two services: GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent and GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon. These services allow Google applications to be safely and securely updated.   I couldn't find, and I'm not aware of any reason it mounts a partition, but it's probably either:  ul liA bunch of information about which updates are available and for what apps/li liUpdates for products, Google Chrome updates are quite regular/li liAn Update for the Updater/li /ul  Ah the endless mysteries of HardwareGrowler. Entertainment for the whole family!  <answer8656> I don't have an answer, but I do know how you can get one.    Mount and unmount a volume probably is the software attaching something.  What software?   GoogleSoftware update.  ( /Library/LaunchAgents/com.googlecode.keystone or something)    Might be in /System/Library, might be in LaunchDaemons.  Whatever it is, it is the automatic software updater.  Automatic updates are IMHO, a terrible idea.  I can buy crap online with my credit card, but suddenly I'm too stupid to even bother trying to get to agree about an update?  Come on!  Don't worry, Google still resolves searches, even when you catch their trojan, because that's what you call applications that download undisclosed software without warning, in action.   Does it tell you "Ohai, just downloaded 2 gigs of updates, including your new CALEA package"?   Most likely not.    Anyway, I'd get on this because DTrace may not work this well by fall.

By the way, those gigs of data were for the 'top sites' function.   You'd call them 'pictures of the websites I went to'  although they use the term 'thumbnails'   I don't know why they want pictures of porn sites ( Safari has gotten so bad I benched it, it's my porn browser now.) , but they got saved.   h3One last note./h3  Any google app you download starts the process.

It would be safe to assume it's part of the Software Update Daemon's checking / updating process. Try checking the Console Log (Console.App) for any entries made by Google apps. <comment6935> Indeed it would.  Thank you for tracking that down.  I did find the .plist files, but I did not find any console log entries for Google apps.  I plan to keep looking. <comment9223> Traitorware.  Use chromium, not chrome.  Look in /var/folders/* <comment9226> Wait , this is the accepted answer? Seriously? <comment9772> @chiggsy I watched this question stay unanswered for a few days - and I thought it would be better to contribute what  I could find out in the hope that it would help. If you've got a problem with the answer, submit a better one - it's better to contribute than complain. <comment9817> I answered this right away. scroll down. The OP had a security concern, and Keystone is troubling in its mode of operation. With respect and not malice, I would say your answer made light of a quite valid concern without providing a way to resolve it.  Keystone might be signed, codesign -v would determine if it actually was from a trusted source, although trusted by apple|google != trusted by all. ( Adobe, I am looking at you.) <comment9875> Fair enough, good explanation.
