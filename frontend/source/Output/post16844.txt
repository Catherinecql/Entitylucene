Who makes the Wifi component on the Macbook Pros? <body> In Apple's Macbook line, who is actually making the Wifi components for them? Intel?  I ask because I've never had any trouble with wireless connections on my Macbook but all the adapters I buy for my PC seem to degrade quickly over time and I'd like to buy something along the lines of what Apple is putting in their machines.  <answer16848> From the SystemProfiler - Network - Airport  precodeCard Type:  AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x8D) Firmware Version:   Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.10.131.42.4) /code/pre  Vendor ID 0x14E4 is for Broadcom http://www.pcidatabase.com/vendor_details.php?id=767
