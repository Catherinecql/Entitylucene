2008 Mac Pro: Any chance of upgrading hardware to current technology? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I upgrade my 2008 Mac Pro completely?       I have a 2nd Gen 2008 Mac Pro 2.8ghz Quad Core with an 8800GT. I'm sure I can get away with the processing power and more RAM for now.  Is there any way possible I can put a modern day GPU inside this machine?  What does it entail to do such customizations?   Could I gut this machine and upgrade it fully to current technology?  Thanks.  <answer9655> You should be good to upgrade to a modern GPU (PCI-X). Keep in mind that you will need to purchase an 'Apple' version of any graphics card you upgrade to.
