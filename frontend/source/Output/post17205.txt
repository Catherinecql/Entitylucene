iSight vs Facetime HD (Macbook vs Macbook Pro) <body> While checking the tech specs I see iSight on Mac book and FaceTime HD on Mac book pro.  I tried finding solution myself through google and sources but found no justifiable response. Can some one tell me the difference ?  <answer17207> The only official specifications I can find on the FaceTime HD camera is that they send 720p HD signal whereas the iSight cameras recorded 640x480.
