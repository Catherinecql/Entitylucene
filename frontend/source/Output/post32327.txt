hyperlink to another worksheet in Numbers 09 <body> Is it possible to hyperlink to another sheet in the same workbook in Numbers '09? I want to have a link so I can jump back and fourth between sheets. Excel has this feature but I can't find anything about it in Numbers. It appears that Numbers only allows hyperlinks to webpages or to send an email.  <answer32334> The short (and sad) answer is: No, unfortunately it is not possible.
