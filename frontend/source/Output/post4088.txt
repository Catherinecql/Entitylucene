Is this nice extension of Mac OS 9 still available on OS X? <body> There was an extension on Mac OS 9 system that I could not live without : This extension offered the following feature :   When a "Choose a file / folder" dialog box appeared, you were able to click on a "visible" opened window to make the selection box "jump" to that particular place in the tree structure of the disk (on the network).  Is there something like this on OS X ?  <answer4089> Not exactly the same but if you drag any file or folder to the dialog panel then it will jump to the location of the dropped item  <answer4097> You are looking for Default Folder X.  <comment3903> Indeed ! Yes, Default folder that was it. But, Ouch, their prices are not nice :-/
