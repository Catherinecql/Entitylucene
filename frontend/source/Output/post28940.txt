Siri seems to usually have network issues. Fix? <body> iPhone 4S: at first, Siri was magical. In the last 3-4 days she usually reports an inability to work due to network issues. I've tried myriad fixes but to no avail. Anyone have ideas?  <answer33430> Siri is still in beta (as of today, 11 December 2011). If you have no trouble accessing other network services on your iPhone 4S, assume that the fault is on Apple's end.  <comment41149> Siri is neither male or female.
