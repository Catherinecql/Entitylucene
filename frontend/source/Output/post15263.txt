iTunes in 2 Countries <body> I have an iTunes account in the UK but I am going to spend 2 months of the year in the US. Is it possible for me to download from the US iTunes Store but keep my UK credit card and billing address?  <answer15264> No, it's not, you'll need a separate credit card and billing address for each country.   A work around would be to use your US address and use gift cards for purchases.   I do this, as I don't live in the US, but want access to some content only available in the US store.   <comment16532> You can still shop the UK store no matter where you are worldwide so you only need a second account if you choose to shop both stores for availability, pricing or whatever other difference you feel is important.
