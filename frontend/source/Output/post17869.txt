Can I use a Carbon Copy Cloner with a source disk that's larger than the target disk? <body> Carbon Copy Cloner is a great utility that's saved me a few times over the years. I've always used a much larger target drive than the source so I've never run into this problem before.  Now I have a 1 TB source and a 750 GB target drive. Only ~300 GB of the source drive is actually used?  Will this work?  <answer17875> Yes - CCC copies by file and so will manage.  This was my original setup and worked. It is now more complex as I now have more data on the source than can fit on the target, I manage this by choosing the files in CCC and deselecting ~/Downloads /tmp etc.  <comment19871> Just confirming that this did indeed work as described.
