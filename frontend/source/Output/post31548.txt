Replace German keyboard of Macbook Pro MC700 <body> I have a German Macbook Pro, but I dont really like the keyboard layout, I would like to replace about 15 keys to make it easier for typing. Is it possible to do so ? And where can I find the black cover of the key (Do I need to buy the white scissors below the black cover as well ???)   <answer31584> You can replace the entire keyboard.
