Does latest MacBook Air have powered USB ports? <body> I see that the latest 13 inch MacBook Air has two USB 2.0 ports, but can they power, say, a 2.5 inch external hard drive?  <answer6291> Yes, the USB ports are powered. In fact, they are designed to power the USB SuperDrive, which draws more power than most USB ports support.  <comment6626> Good to know, thank you!
