Problem when updating using Software Update <body> I tried to update Mac OS X using Software Update. But when I tap on software updates, it's checking software updates and listing the available updates.   I didn't see Mac OS X update available in the list. I am not able to do this. Can you guys please help ?  <answer11486> What is your current OS X version ??  The latest OS X is 10.6.7 - and if you can't get it through "Software Update", then you can download the whole OS X v10.6.7 Update Combo here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1361  <answer11532> You may already be on the latest version (check with the menu item strong/strong  strongAbout This Mac/strong).br If not, you may have accidentally “Ignored” the update (⌫ in emSoftware Update/em or the menu item strongUpdate/strong  strongIgnore Update…/strong).  You might try the emSoftware Update/em menu item strongSoftware Update/strong  strongReset Ignored Updates/strong (it is only enabled if you have Ignored an update in the past).
