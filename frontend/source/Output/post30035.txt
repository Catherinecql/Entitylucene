Helping to manage my amazon ec2 servers on my ipad <body> I am looking for apps that would help me to manage my amazon EC2 servers on an iPad. Are there any apps like that?   <answer30043> I've used Cloud Services Manager to monitor and control my EC2, EBS and S3 instances and storage. Works okay. I wouldn't say it was wonderful, but it'll do in a pinch. If you're used to Elastic Fox you may find it a bit disappointing. Not quite as nice as EF.  More often than not I just use Panic's Prompt ssh client for iOS. It's quite good as ssh clients go and I'll use it to gain access to a known-good instance from which I can then run my own boto-enabled inspection tools or any of the standard EC2 command line utilities.  Between those two I can usually handle most of my EC2 issues from an iOS device.  <comment34792> thanks for the answer. What do you mean by known good instance? How do you make one? Do you use a fixed ip? <comment34875> @gyurisc by known-good instance I mean an instance I know is up and running, one I know the public IP for. I have long-running instances in EC2 I can use for ssh access from iOS devices in a pinch. Some of them have fixed IPs. Some I just wrote the hostname down for.
