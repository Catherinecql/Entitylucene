Set IP adress for the wifi hotspot on OSX <body> If I share my ethernet over WiFi I would like to specify the IP address of the hotspot (for now it defaults to 10.0.2.1). Can this be set somewhere in system settings?  Note: the ethernet is not connected. I just run a local web server that should be accessible by some clients connection to my hotspot (and therefore I should have a fix IP address).  <answer29041> AFAICT, this is managed by the process com.apple.InternetSharing. When it is enabled, the file code/etc/bootpd.plist/code is created. Here it has your IP address 10.0.2.1  However, this file is deleted and recreated when Internet Sharing restarts, so modifying it is pointless. I bet that the codedefaults/code command can be used to set a new IP address, however codedefaults read/code and codesudo defaults read/code do not cite anything related to "com.apple.InternetSharing".  I know this isn't a complete answer, but if you find whatever is creating code/etc/bootpd.plist/code you'll probably accomplish your goal. You may want to read this earlier question about Internet Sharing.  <comment33362> thanks a lot for this hint. I will check it.
