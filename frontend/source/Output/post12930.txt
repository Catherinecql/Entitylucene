can't download apps after "authorizing computer" <body> I recently synced my iPod touch(4th gen) for the first time and it asked me if I wanted to "authorize the computer"- I chose "yes" but now, I can't download apps(neither from my ipod nor from the computer). It asks for credit card info. but since I don't have a credit card, now I can't download apps(free ones) at all.   Deauthorizing doesn't seem to help either.   <answer12931> Try this procedure to create an iTunes App Store account without a credit card.  <comment13576> @Rob- Thanks, it worked. I had already created an account but selecting None in the card type helped in the verification too. :)
