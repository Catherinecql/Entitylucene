transfering itunes library win-> mac - is it possible? <body> I'm about to order one of the new macbook airs and wanted to know if it is possible to transfer my itunes library from my old windows machine to the mac. I know you can do win-win and mac-mac, but can you do win- mac? If so, how?  With the music I'm not too concerned with play-counts and ratings, I just want the music, album and cover-art. With the apps, I know I could share them with a "new" itunes library but would have to purchase them again if I need to update. Is there a way to circumvent that and make my new itunes library my "main" one?  <answer18103> Short answer: just copy the iTunes folder from the Windows machine to the mac.  It works fine, I did it myself last year with no problems.  Longer answer with more details at http://www.macworld.com/article/146958/2010/03/move_itunes_windows_mac.html  <answer19986> Just copying the iTunes folder to a HDD will probably be simplest, but if you don't have a ton of music, and you want to transfer some documents and photos you could use migration assistant over your home network. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4796  Never done it that way myself but migration assistant is generally a pretty good tool.
