How do I connect an internal SATA drive to Mini-SAS? <body> I have a SATA III SSD which I would like to connect to an ATTO technologies' SATA II card in my Mac Pro. The SSD uses the typical internal SATA interface while the ATTO card uses Mini-SAS both internally and externally.  What do I need to plug the SSD into the ATTO card? I'm assuming internal/external doesn't matter, and that I'd get the same speeds either way, correct?  <answer20973> This is the proper cable:  http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/Adaptec-Serial-Attached-SCSI-SAS-external-cable-1.6-ft/1217280.aspx  Details:  precodeInterface Provided   Connector Qty:         1   Connector Type:        36 pin 4i Mini MultiLane SAS (SFF-8087)  Interface Required   Connector Qty:         4   Connector Type:        29 pin internal SAS (SFF-8482) /code/pre
