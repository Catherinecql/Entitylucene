PDF Searching/Http Syncing on iPad <body> I have two requirements with handling PDFs on an iPad, but I can't seem to find one app that will solve the problem. I was hoping the iOS 4.2 update would address this, but it doesn't.  Here are my requirements:  ol liI need to be able to search for words in a PDF./li liI need to have this PDF sync to a HTTP url. That is to say, I want my PDF on my iPad to be the exact same (the latest revision) of my PDF on my HTTP server./li /ol  The ideal solution would be able to just use Safari and open up the PDF via Safari. However, with Safari, I can't search for text within a PDF.  Any thoughts on how I can solve my problem? Any apps out there that will do this? iBooks or Goodreader don't.  Thanks in advance.  <answer4293> DropBox and iAnnotate, and since iAnnotate supports DropBox you really only work with one program as requested.
