How to connect to wireless TV satellite receiver from Mac OS X <body> How could I connect to my satellite receiver from Mac OS X and be able to watch TV and navigate through channel list? Is there any free software that could do this?  <answer3128> The closest thing to what you want would probably be the SlingBox.  It's not possible to do this with just software, unfortunately. Satellite and cable boxes are pretty locked down, so you need a hybrid hardware/software solution like the SlingBox.  <answer3139> Not free and not software, but if you want the best results, you'll need the EyeTV HD from Elgato.   <answer3410> use dreambox tv satellite receiver , connect to your network and your mac via wireless on the mac !dreamX maybe you have to use VLD video viewer
