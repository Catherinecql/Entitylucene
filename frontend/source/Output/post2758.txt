Where did Mail.app just put my email? <body> Mail.app seems built to punish us for not having inbox-zero.  I hear a chime telling me new mail has arrived, but with a list of mailboxes that look like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jVbys.png" alt="screenshot"  how can I possibly tell which one has emnew/em new mail, as opposed to the emold/em new mail? Or better yet, is it possible to make an email's newness expire after a certain period?  <answer2759> Create a Smart Mailbox with "Message is Unread" and sort it by Date Received.  I have this setup as my default mailbox for processing my email. I also have the Mail.app dock icon badge set to point to this Mailbox so I can see how much unread mail I have, though in your case this won't be an advantage.  Pro Tip. Just mark all those messages as strikeunread/strike read. You're never going to read them.  <answer2761> When I used Mail, I had a lot of smart mailboxes, but one of the most used ones (and their main conditions) where:  UNREAD (message is unread)  TODAY (date received is TODAY)  YESTERDAY (date received is YESTERDAY)  WEEK (date received is within 7 days from now)  MONTH (date received is within 30 days from now).  FLAGGED (message is flagged)  And every year, I’d create a (new) one like this:  2010 (message is received between 1/1/2010 and 31 dec 2010).  2009 (like 2010, but with the correct dates)  etc.  Those ones were inside a folder. It allowed me to group messages by year, because sometimes I needed a message that I got in 2008…  Of course I’d add other conditions like not in spam/trash, etc. Sometimes you have to “nest” smartmailboxes. Like have one that is message is not in spam or thrash. And then a new smart mailbox that says: Message is not in  + other conditions.   The reasoning behind all this smartmailboxing is that once you start getting thousands of emails, searching in mail is not fast. For that reason I switched to Gmail, but that’s just my personal preference.   <comment2451> That's why I'd like the unread status to expire automatically. Marking them unread isn't a long-term solution. <comment2458> That’s why I switched to gmail, archive and forget :) <comment2466> You can also alter the smart mailboxes to only show those where date received is  some date <comment2485> Sorry, I miss-typed. I meant mark then all as READ.
