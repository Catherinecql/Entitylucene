Multi-finger Capable iOS Web App <body> Some time ago, I had a bookmark on my iPhone for a WebApp I believe to be called "Sparkie". It was a web app that would display electric arcs for every finger that tapped the screen, and would draw lines in-between multiple fingers. It goes without saying that it appears I've lost the bookmark.  In my attempts to search for it, I have found Matt Gemmell's Multi-Finger Test app, but I am not able to deploy it to my iPad because I am not a paying iOS developer.  Anyone out there know of the WebApp I'm searching for?  <answer14962> And I just clicked "Older Comments" on Matt Gemmell's blog, and found the link. You have GOT to be kidding me.  http://spark.attrakt.se/
