Image quality of various Apple cinema displays <body> I have concluded that my office is in sore need of a new display and have decided to take the hit for one of apple's refurbished displays.  The most important thing for me is similar pixels/square inch (so that the same size font shows up the same size on each monitor).  Is there a screen-definition difference between the most recent MacBook Pros and any of the currently available cinema displays on Apple's site?  I could not find any such specs in the product descriptions.  <answer11612> Using this calculator, I discovered that the following:  24" cinema display has 94 PPIbr 27" cinema display has 109 PPIbr 30" cinema display has 100 PPIbr 15.4" MacBook Pro has 110 PPI  Thus the 27" is going to be the closest PPI to my current display.
