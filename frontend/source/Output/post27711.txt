Can you export or share Categories in Outlook 2011? <body> Is there any way to export or otherwise copy Categories, with colors, between Users/Macs?  They also don't yet synch to Exchange 2010, from what I can tell.  I'll likely develop a default new user profile and then run an AppleScript to add the Exchange account based on the currently logged in user's credentials, so I can set up defaults that way, hoping that there's a way to export or copy categories however.  <answer27714> Sadly, and unfortunatly No. This is something I spend a few days on recently, and out of interest, it can't be done on the Windows version either. There is no way to keep these categories intact, and it can be a huge problem, especially when sharing items with others since the minute they make a change to a shared item, the categories are overwritten.  You could possibly however use an AppleScript to add them manually, I haven't tried thought.  <answer75245> we had the same problem. That's why we created the Exchange Category Exporter, which enables you to export contacts based on their given category.

Sincerely,  Wolfgang  <comment31795> It is somewhat possible under Windows with a really ugly script that manipulates a blob in the registry. <comment87384> The original question concerned exporting the actual categories, not contacts.  Contacts can be filtered, then dragged out from the Contacts window.
