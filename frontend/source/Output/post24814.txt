How to resolve network issue or DNS to access web page on Snow Leopard Server? <body> I have my network setup like as follows:  internet  router 1  ethernet ports  switch  router 2  I have a Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server connected to "router 1", but it is so slow when accessing a web page hosted on the server from a browser on a workstation connected to either router 1 or router 2?  Is there a problem with my network setup or maybe because I changed the name to newservername.local?  <answer24832> This would most commonly be a problem with MTU sizes. Try setting yours to something a bit smaller (1450 or so), you can do this under the strongHardware/strong tab in strongNetwork preferences/strong.  <comment29074> Don't name your server with the .local extension. Bad things happen, as the .local extension is reserved for Bonjour services. Change it back.
