Why does my 13" MacBook Pro have trouble running Adobe Bridge on a 27" Apple Monitor? <body> Configuration: 13" MacBook Pro  2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 8GB RAM  running Lion Video: NVIDIA GeForce9400M 256MB.  Apple 27" LED Cinema Display  It is a nice little computer but I am having trouble running Adobe CS5 Bridge. If I have even a few applications open, Bridge will flake out and I can't navigate to new folders or I get partial display.  If I close Bridge and disconnect the monitor I can open Bridge fine on the laptop. I then plug in the monitor and can continue to work.  This seems to be rather archaic, so I am wondering if there is something wrong with the video card or is there another reason I am having trouble running Bridge? What is the solution?  I would appreciate some expert insights.  Thanks.  <answer26390> First off, make sure you've run AAM to update all components to latest:  precode/Library/Application Support/Adobe/OOBE/PDApp/core/Adobe Application Manager.app /code/pre  What happens when you set your displays to mirror (command-F1), launch Bridge, then revert back to extended?  <comment30152> Hi da4. Bridge and all other apps are current. I even tried downloading the trial version of Photoshop CS5.1 with Bridge 5.1 I get the same results there.
