Quicktime for windows 7 64 bit <body> I am using windows 7 64 bit on hp probook 4520s and want to install quicktime, apple provided link give the quicktime to download and install but it give error of some assembly instruction. I think that version of quick time is for 32 bit, microsoft have also given the same url for isntalling quicktime on windows 7 64 bit on its website so can some one please tell me from where I can get 64 bit version and solve my problem.  thanks in advance guys-  <answer13126> Quicktime is a part of the iTunes install, so if you download the 64 bit version of iTunes, you will get it as a package deal.  You should probably try uninstalling all apple components first if you are getting error codes on installing.   Could you also paste those error codes for further troubleshooting?
