Automator folder action questions <body> As I asked in this post, I could make it that a file in a directory can be renamed automatically, but I have some questions about this action.  ul liWhere to the workflow files are copied? When I run 'save as', it doesn't seem to show the directory where the file is copied./li liHow is this folder action stored and restored so that it runs automatically when system reboots? In other words, I guess I don't have to rerun automator whenever I reboot, how does this possible?/li /ul  h2ADDED/h2  ol liI found that the automator workflow is stored in "~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions/"/li liI also found that folder action from automator workflow is also registered by running "/System/Library/CoreServices/Folder Actions Setup.app" /li /ol  <answer3010>    Where to the workflow files are copied?   I don't understand this question.     Is this folder action stored in a system so that it's working even after my reboot?   By default, folder actions are stored in the code/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/code folder.
