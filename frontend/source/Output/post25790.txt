How do I get iCal push notifications working? <body> If I update an event on my iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.3.3, it is updated correctly on the MobileMe calendar web site, but not on iCal – I have to refresh the latter manually. I took a look at my system log, and there are entries like this:     Sep 23 10:40:59 Musa applepushserviced[147]: : Stream error occurred for : Error Domain=kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork Code=2 UserInfo=0x10012d5e0 "The operation couldn’t be completed. (kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 2.)"   Could this be responsible? If so, what is the solution?  <answer68326> I haven't been able to locate any documentation on the returned error. My best advice is to submit this as a bug report to Apple. If they haven't heard of it before, their engineers will get back to you for some more information, and may even offer the solution.  <answer140848> MobileMe was discontinued on June 30, 2012. Your phone isn't able to sync because the sync servers are no longer available. If you want to sync calendars with an iOS 4 device, you might have to use a Google account and IMAP.   <comment61911> Are you still having this issue? What version of OSX are you running.  Also, have you since updated to 5.1.1?  Works great on my 3GS.
