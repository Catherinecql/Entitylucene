AppleScript to spit out Incremented Number with Leading Zeros <body> So I am trying to create a simple script that will use a file to store an integer. When the script is called (in my case as part of a keyboard macro) it will drop in (where I'm typing) the current integer, with the requisite number of leading zeros. Then it will increment the integer (without the leading zeros) and write it back into the file.  The leading zeros part works, but for the life of me I can not figure out how to store the value of the 'counter' variable in a file so that, later, when I call the script again, it will pick up where it left off.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Here is the error message I get:  precode    error "Can’t make \"z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter\"       into type file." number -1700 from     "z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter" to file /code/pre  And here is the code:  precode    set theFile to "z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter"         open for access theFile         set fileContents to read theFile         close access theFile          set counter to fileContents as integer           on add_leading_zeros(counter, max_leading_zeros)         set the threshold_number to (10 ^ max_leading_zeros) as integer         if counter is less than the threshold_number then             set the leading_zeros to ""             set the digit_count to the length of ((counter div 1) as string)             set the character_count to (max_leading_zeros + 1) - digit_count             repeat character_count times                 set the leading_zeros to (the leading_zeros &amp; "0") as string             end repeat             return (leading_zeros &amp; (counter as text)) as string         else             return counter as text         end if     end add_leading_zeros      add_leading_zeros(counter, 2)       open for access newFile with write permission     set eof of newFile to 0     write counter + 1 to newFile     close access newFile /code/pre  <answer9301> Add a code.txt/code extension to the file you're saving to. If codecounter/code is the folder, do this:  precodeset theFile to "z:Users:zachphillips:Dev:AppleScripts:counter:save.txt" /code/pre  Assuming that you have a valid path, this should fix the problem. Otherwise, you're trying to save to a folder.
