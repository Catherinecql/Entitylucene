How do I find out what application is trying to wake my MBP? <body> my mac book pro is refusing to stay asleep. I noticed it will wake up roughly every thirty minutes and display the screensaver password screen and even when the lid is closed I will be able to hear it wake and then go back to sleep quite regularly. I installed please sleep but that didn't fix it either. another curious thing I noticed was that sometimes when waking the mbp from sleep it will not let me type anything into the username/password fields. only closing the lid and reopening it after a few seconds will fix this.   I'm running 10.6.7 on a 17" 2.66ghz mbp i7 with 8gb ram.  my question is this: how do I find out which app is trying to constantly wake up my system? (wake for networks access is disabled.)  <answer20473> I think you'll need further info to proceed. Have you checked the console log for status messages? Also, do you have any peripherals/USB hardware items attached? If so, reboot without them and see if the problem persists.  <answer20474> One way would be to have /Application/Utilities/Console.app running and when you MBP awakes, check the logs. It will normally log a reason for wakeup, e.g.  precode06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: Wake reason: EHC1 06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: The USB device HubDevice (Port 1 of Hub at 0xfd000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (2) 06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: The USB device Keyboard Hub (Port 2 of Hub at 0xfd100000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3) 06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: The USB device Apple Keyboard&gt; (Port 2 of Hub at 0xfd120000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3) /code/pre  <answer24225> Macs will wake up in response to many hardware events. Changing a USB/Firewire/Thunderbolt cable or even plugging in / powering on a connected device will wake Macs that are sleeping. Keyboard presses, clamshell sensor detecting an open of the display lid will also wake up a sleeping Mac. These are pretty well known and obvious, even if you don't realize a pet or power fluctuation can cause a wake event.  Two software items will also wake a sleeping mac and both rely on the power management / system management controller. Both are seen in the Energy Saver preference pane. This is how applications can do the same thing as hardware and wake your mac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xNpes.png" alt="enter image description here"  For macs with a battery - the power adapter needs to be connected and powered for much of this to work. The strongWake for network access/strong is both the standard WakeOnLan (WOL) as well as Apple's Bonjour Sleep Proxy. I like the article About Wake on Demand that explains how Apple has extended the concept of WOL and made a service.  If you disable these two items - software can no longer wake your sleeping mac and you can know if it's a hardware event or a software event. The other answers go into how to look at the logs to know which event has made a specific wake up request. Hopefully this helps frame the bigger picture of how your mac can take a cat nap with one eye open.  <comment23241> I followed your advice but all I get is console telling me it got sleep and wake notices from the system. it looks like this:   09.08.11 07:49:51 PleaseSleep[172] Sleep notification received from the system 09.08.11 08:31:02 PleaseSleep[172] Wake notification received from the system <comment30598> It's most likely wake-on-LAN. I had the same problem on my old MacBook Pro.
