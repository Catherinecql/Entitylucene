Why won't Subversion remember certificates? <body> I'm using Terminal and committing some data to a remote SVN server... every time I get the same message about a new certificate, and I choose to "permanently" accept the cert and it works. However, the next time I commit... same thing. Why isn't the cert being remembered, and how can I fix this?  precodeflat:smarty e$ svn commit ./ -m commit  Error validating server certificate for 'https://x.svn.x.com:443':  - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority.

Did it work at one point in the past, or has it always been a problem?  Most likely the issue is somewhere inside of code~/.subversion/auth//code. You could try blowing away the directory, though that will require you to recreate all your credentials. (Maybe something in there is borking up authentication process.)  I suggest you try to recreate your problem with another user profile, computer, or operating system, and compare code~/.subversion/code directories with your broken system.  If you are convinced its the Terminal's fault, you can try iTerm2, though I expect the same results in the same environment. Good luck!  <answer36142> I've had the same issue, all files in code~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server//code were set to strongread-only/strong.  Running codechmod u+w ~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/*/code fixed it.  <comment32997> Erasing ~/.subversion completely did the job-- thanks. best, E
