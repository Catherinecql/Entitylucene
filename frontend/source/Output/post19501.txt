Can Mail count unread messages (for the Dock icon) from only some of my accounts? <body> I have 7 mail accounts configured with Apple Mail. The dock icon shows the count of new emails for all of my accounts. How can I disable notification for 2 of those 7 accounts, so it just shows me the counter for the other 5 accounts?  <answer19534> I'm not aware of a way to do this natively, but DockStar offers this kind of functionality, among other things. Their FAQ states that the latest version supports Lion, as well.  <answer20978> Do a SmartMailbox with the folders from which you want the counts to come, and then select that in Mail's General settings -- "Dock unread count" (it's the fourth drop down list)
