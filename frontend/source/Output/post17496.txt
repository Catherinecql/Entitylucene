To to disable a service form OS X by using recovery console? <body> I cannot boot my system anymore and I want to disable a service from loading and the only way to do this by using the terminal window from the recovery mode.  launchctl is not available in the recovery mode.  <answer17501> Try doing a Safe Boot by holding down the shift key on boot. This will boot, but disable all login items/services. From there, you should be able to disable the problem and boot normally.

(Often in single user mode you can look over /private/var/log/system.log and tell which task is hanging and be somewhat surgical about pruning launchd agents/daemons)  Here are the relevant folders from the link above:  precodeFILES      ~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user.      /Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator.      /Library/LaunchDaemons         System-wide daemons provided by the administrator.      /System/Library/LaunchAgents   Per-user agents provided by Mac OS X.      /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  System-wide daemons provided by Mac OS X. /code/pre  You can also start launchd by hand (as well as load the tasks one by one manually) once you've learned how it works - I wouldn't recommend trying it for the first time on a broken mac - test and learn first on a mac that works and is fully backed up.  <answer82658> If you've disabled certain bits in launchd ... booting OS x in safe mode wont even work.
