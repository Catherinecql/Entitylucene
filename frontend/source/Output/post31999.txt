How can I get iCal to sync with iCloud while running Snow Leopard? <body> I have been looking for a few weeks for a workaround to get iCal on Snow leopard to sync with iOS 5 devices with iCloud.  Is there a work around that will allow syncing as I cannot upgrade to OSX Lion?  <answer32000> I have found a suitable work around that I have been testing for a couple of days.   While using iCal on a Mac running Snow Leopard, I needed to add an account to iCal. This account would point to iCloud and sync with it.  So, open Preferences and select accounts, enter the add account window by hitting +.  this takes you to:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/39Anz.png" alt="enter image description here"  You need to choose CalDav and enter your Apple ID email address (not your .me.com email address)  enter in your password and the server name which in most cases is codep06-caldav.icloud.com/code  Once this has been added you will need to uncheck some of the calendars in the 'on my mac' menu.  <comment36692> if you are using a gmail address make sure you are using the CalDav server (it may try to reroute to gmail, if it does you can use your apple@me.com email address.
