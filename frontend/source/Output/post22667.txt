Always show service in contextual menu <body> Sometimes when I create a service in Automator, I want it to always appear in the Finder contextual menu, not just when I have a selected a file or folder.br The services are always either pure applescript or pure bash, so if it can be done some other way without using Automator, I'm also satisfied.  <answer22682> I've mentioned before that the commercial utility Unsanity FruitMenu allows customization of Finder emcontextual/em menus. You could launch an AppleScript or Automator document from the contextual menu with this utility. But FruitMenu requires Rosetta and therefore won't work in Lion. I don't know if Unsanity is developing a way to implement this in Lion, or not.  <comment25287> I'm using Lion, so this won't work as you said.
