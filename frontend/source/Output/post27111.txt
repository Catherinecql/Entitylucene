subscribe to a podcast on iPhone <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What apps are available for subscribing to podcasts directly on the iPhone       Does anyone have a clever hack to subscribe to podcasts on iOS?

I'm looking for something that automatically downloads podcasts as they become available (when on wifi) and doesn't require me to plug in to a computer.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions you might have.
