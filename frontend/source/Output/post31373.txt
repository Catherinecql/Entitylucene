How can I automatically upload files to remote server when I make changes <body> I want to automatically upload files to a remote server when I make any changes in them using some editor. Is there some app which I can use for this purpose?   I know that this kind of thing is available in Panic Coda, but I want to continue using my favorite editor instead of switching to Coda.  <answer31374> It may depend on what type of files and what type of connection to the server you're using, but a good starting point would probably be Cyberduck, an FTP/SFTP client. You can open files directly off the server with any program on your Mac you choose, edit them as you would a local file (I believe they're actually stored in temporary local storage), and uploaded whenever your changes are saved.  Most other FTP programs should have this functionality built in as well.
