Why does iTunes want my Security Code when I have Store Credit? <body> I have $10.00 next to my name in the iTunes screeen.  I click to buy "Surfin Safari" (by the Beach Boys) for $0.99.  I am then asked for the security code on my Credit Card.  Why?  Why can't it just take it from the iTunes gift card I put in?  GRRRRRrrrrrr.... Frustration!  <answer21752> Duh!  Just click 'None' for the credit card type.  Not totally intuitive, but I should have figure this out without a question...
