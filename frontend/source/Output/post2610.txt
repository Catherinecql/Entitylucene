How can I boot in "Safe Mode" with rEFIt <body> I would like to boot safe mode but I can't because of my rEFIt.   Holding the kbdShift/kbd button at startup has no effect, I just get the rEFIt menu and OSX starts to boot normally.  any ideas how to do it?  <answer2617> The question on this page appears to be the same issue. Someone responded with a detailed solution, which might work for you as well.
