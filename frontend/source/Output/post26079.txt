Ethernet driver missing when installing Windows using boot camp <body> I installed Windows 7 64 bit using bootcamp. The Ethernet driver is missing. Can't find it search on disk.  Where do I get this driver?   I have a Macbook Pro OS X  <answer26083> Didn't read instructions. Using boot camp assistant, I need to select option to download Windows drivers and burn them on CD. Then boot into Windows and insert CD which will launch an installer for the drivers.
