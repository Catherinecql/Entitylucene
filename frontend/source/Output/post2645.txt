What services that I can't use when I unsubscribe the mobile me? <body> I've used mobile me(me.com) quite a while, but I happen to know and use DropBox.  DropBox is much better than iDisk in terms of easy of use, size, speed, and many things. I'm considering discontinue to use mobile me to switch to 50G option of Dropbox ($100/year), but before doing that, I need to know what services that I cannot use.
