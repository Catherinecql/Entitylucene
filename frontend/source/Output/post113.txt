Is there any way to get a pop-up notification on my iPhone or iPad when mail arrives? <body> I have gmail set up to send me "true" push notifications (using the exchange server setup).  So my mail arrives in realtime, and I instantly get badges on my springboard screen to indicate new messages.    But I want to be able to get a pop-up with the sender and subject, like I would with an SMS, or an IM using Beejive.  Is there really no way to do this?  It would be especially helpful when I'm in another app, and don't mind the pop-up's interruption, but would like to know who the message is from before deciding to leave the app to check mail.  <answer114> Give BoxCar a go.  I use it in a similar way for Twitter Direct Message notifications.  <answer329> I use a combination of Notify and Prowl, running on a spare Mac.  I found so many other uses for Prowl, such as sending push notifications from a script.  <answer1283> Don't use the standard Gmail configuration from iPhone, use Google Sync.   Here: Google Sync: Set Up Your Apple Device for Google SyncShare Comment  <answer21027> I use a combo of Apple Mail rules, an AppleScript, and Howl (another growl app similar to Prowl mentioned above).  Name the Mail rule like so: "growl-TestPost" as indicated in the AppleScript, then set up the considitons and trigger this AppleScript to run. Then set up your Growl display style to use that of Howl (or Prowl).  Here is the AppleScript, unfortunately I do not have info on the original author's script which I modified:  precodeon run     -- at current, the registration is done whenever you launch the script,      -- and also below whenever the the script itself is run by Mail     -- (that let's users make new notification on the fly, sort of...)     -- could probably find a more graceful semaphor, but...     register() end run  using terms from application "Mail"     on perform mail action with messages messageList for rule theRule         set theRuleName to name of theRule         if theRuleName does not start with "growl-" then return          register()         -- extract notification type from rule name         set noteType to characters 7 thru (length of theRuleName) of theRuleName as text         repeat with thisMessage in messageList              -- basic information for notification             set theSender to sender of thisMessage             set theSubject to subject of thisMessage             set theText to (content of thisMessage)             set tid to AppleScript's text item delimiters             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to " "             try                 set theSummary to (text items 1 through 20 of theText) as text             on error                 set theSummary to theText             end try             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to tid              -- notify             tell application "GrowlHelperApp" to notify with name noteType ¬                 title noteType description ¬                 "From: " &amp; theSender &amp; return &amp; "Subject: " &amp; theSubject ¬                 application name "MailGrowl"         end repeat         -- if we want to coalesce or order the notifications, then we'd put the          -- notifications into an array above and notify GHA here.

Goto SettingsNotificationsMail the choose "Alerts" in the alert style menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3WTNC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  you will then have something that looks like a message notification when an email arrives  <comment379> I agree so much. Prowl is amazing... <comment11207> He already mentioned he did use that.
