Full size keyboard with built in stand for iPhone? <body> I'm looking for bluetooth keyboards for use with my iPhone. I'd like a full size keyboard that has a built in iPhone stand. Everything I've found so far with a built in stand is almost full size but not quite. Are there any full size keyboard options with built in iPhone stands? A case for the apple bluetooth keyboard that had a stand built in would also work but I haven't found one of these.  <answer30513> For what it's worth, have you taken a look at the Apple iPad Keyboard Dock Wired Keyboard?  It doesn't have a number pad but otherwise is a full sized keyboard that shouldn't even need bluetooth.  Of course I am assuming that it will work with an iPhone even though it was made for an iPad.  <answer71351> The best solution I've found for this is the Wing Stand with an Apple bluetooth keyboard. while it isn't the most stable setup it works fine for setting the phone on a table along with the keyboard and typing.  <comment34978> Hmmm... a keyboard with a built-in dock connector for my iPhone.  I might buy that! <comment37970> Any bluetooth keyboard will work with an iPhone or iPad.
