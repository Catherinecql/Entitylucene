Can I read the synced iBooks books from iTunes as well? <body> I've noticed there is a new category in my iTunes (Books), with all the boocks I synced from the iPad.  Can I read books in iTunes on my computer as well ?  If not, there is some other way to read them, since they are stored on my mac ?  thanks  <answer14607> The books and PDFs are stored, as all other media files (if media organization is turned on), in your iTunes Media Folder (Music/iTunes/iTunes Media). You can use Adobe Digital Editions or any other ePub reader for OS X to read them.
