How do I tell if a disk image (.sparseimage) is encrypted? <body> Is there a way to confirm that an image is encrypted? When I choose "Get info" in Finder, it reveals nothing, and when I use Disk utility I also can't seem to see the information.  I know I could try mount it on another machine and see if I need to use a password, but I'm looking for a clean way to get OSX to tell me that it's encrypted.   <answer26795> from the command line you can use 'codehdiutil isencrypted {image-name}/code'.  precodebash-3.2$ hdiutil isencrypted unencrypted.sparseimage encrypted: NO bash-3.2$ hdiutil isencrypted encrypted.sparseimage encrypted: YES blocksize: 512 uuid: FC3C26ED-3056-4F98-8248-DD2F16B39357 private-key-count: 0 passphrase-count: 1 max-key-count: 1 version: 2 bash-3.2$ /code/pre  <answer26796> codehdiutil isencrypted &lt;image-name&gt;/code will do the trick.  From the hdiutil(1) man page :     isencrypted image: print a line indicating whether image is encrypted.  If it is, additional details are printed.   <answer26797> Here's a few ways to check. The last one only works in Lion. The third one is probably the easiest if you're comfortable using Terminal.  br /  strongLock All Keychains/strong  A quick way to check is to open Keychain Access (found in /Applications/Utilities/), choose File  Lock All Keychains, then try to mount the disk image.   If it's encrypted, you should get a message like      diskimages-helper wants to use the "login" keychain   and be prompted for the keychain password (same as your OS X login password). If it's not encrypted, it will simply mount.  br /  strongSearch login Keychain/strong  Instead of locking all keychains, you could instead search for your disk image in the login keychain: Select the login keychain, then type the name of the .sparseimage file in the search field.   However, if the .sparseimage name has been changed since it was created, it won't show up in the login keychain with the new name.   If you don't find your disk image you can try the Lock All Keychains method above or the Terminal method below to be certain.  br /  strongTerminal Command/strong  You can enter the following command to check if the disk image is encrypted:  precodehdiutil imageinfo /path/to/image | grep Encryption /code/pre  Replace the code/path/to/image/code with the path to the disk image. If the disk image is encrypted, the command will return something like:  precode     Encryption: AES-128 /code/pre  If it's not encrypted, it won't show anything at all.  br /  strongUse Disk Utility in Lion/strong  New in Lion, Disk Utility now shows if a disk image is encrypted.   ol liUnmount the disk image if it's mounted. /li liOpen Disk Utility and drag the .sparseimage file to the device list on the left side of the Disk Utility window. /li liSelect the .sparseimage in the device list and look at the information area at the bottom of the window. If the disk is encrypted, then that will be indicated under "Disk Write Status"./li /ol  <answer178685> I tried this with Mavericks. It was surprisingly hard to tell if my disk image was truly encrypted, or if it simply had the same name as an image that was previously encrypted.  As long as it had been mounted one time, Disk Utility did not show it as encrypted. Locking Keychain access did not help, it is as though OS X was caching encryption keys.  I had to unmount the image, remove all references in Keychain Access, then try to mount it. Then I got asked for a password.  Once it's in a state where Mavericks requests a password, Disk Utility DID show the image file (not mounted image) as "Not mounted, encrypted".  If you dismount first, and are willing to use terminal, then as noted by Patrix and Stephen, hdiutil isencrypted {image-name} works with Mavericks.  <comment30572> :-) You beat me by a few seconds here...
