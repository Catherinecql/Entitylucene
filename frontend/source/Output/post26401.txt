How do I save data from old 2 old iPhones then transfer data from one to the other? <body> My wife has an iPhone 3, 8GB, that is slowly dying. My mother (who is dead) left me her iPhone, a 16GB 3GS.  How do I:  ol liKeep all the information from the phones. My mother's phone especially has sentimental value?/li liWipe the 3GS?/li liTransfer everything from the 3 to the 3GS?/li /ol  We don't care if the phone is jail-broken or not (they are not at the moment). Both phones are on the same provider.  <answer26411> iTunes can back up everything except for data that came from a computer.  That means apps not authorized on your iTunes, music from a computer and pictures not taken on the device (stored in the camera roll) are strongnot backed up/strong. Assuming you don't need to recover that information, just back up the devices and archive the iTunes backup folders so you can re-load those backups on another comparable device from a PC or a Mac.  Read up on the details here:  ul liiPhone and iPod touch: About backups/li /ul  Once you've got a sure backup (I'd get a loaner phone from a friend to check the restore to see that you are happy before erasing any of the devices), you can then restore the "wife" backup onto the "mom" phone.  <answer75885> You may try the "restore and backup" function on iTunes.Made a bakup for your iPhone 3 first and then restore your iPhone 3gs from the iPhone 3' backup files.
