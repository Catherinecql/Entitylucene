iPod energy saving <body> I wonder if there is a difference in battery consumption between these two cases :  ul liI shut down the iPod with no app on./li liI shut down the iPod with an app on./li /ul  Is the app really paused, or is it still consuming power while "hibernate" ?  <answer1402> It should be close to the same; when you “suspend” your iPhone/Pod/Pad, all applications are suspended and only minimal services remain on (like Push, music player helper in case you press play from a headphone control, alarms if you have calendar, etc.).   But 3rd party applications are stopped, unless they have a service using the multitask API. But say you have X-Plane running and you suddenly turn the device off (suspending it). The app is automatically saved to “memory” and the process is stopped. No emadditional/em battery should be used until the iPod is powered up again.
