Upload photos to specified photo album, on iPad <body> Are there any ways to move photos from the default album to a specified album?  Maybe there exist some iPad apps for that?  I know how to do that using iTunes, but you know, it's very uncomfortable :(  <answer1257> Unfortunately, no.  The iPad (as of 3.2.1) does not support the manipulation of photo albums by code running on an iPad through any approved mechanism.
