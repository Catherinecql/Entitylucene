Growl notifications with Mail.app? <body> Is it possible to configure Mail.app to use the growl notifications for incoming mail ?  Maybe there is an external script doing that too ?  <answer12954> You need to download GrowlMail, however every time MacOS X is updated the version of GrowlMail becomes outdated and won't run (under Snow Leopard, at least).   I think that the current version of GrowlMail doesn't work with Mac OS X 10.6.7 at present. Details of why it keeps breaking are here. It is annoying but seems unavoidable.  <answer12972> Growl is great, but there's a standalone extension that adds way more functionality to Mail.app. It's called Herald: http://erikhinterbichler.com/software/herald/  Herald is continuing the awesome tradition of Mail.appetizer, if you remember that one from a few years ago. It is superior.  <answer21029> I outlined my method of using Growl in conjunction with Apple Mail, mail rules and AppleScript here: Is there any way to get a pop-up notification on my iPhone or iPad when mail arrives?  The code for the AppleScript is also included in the answer I provided.  <comment13594> But a fix can found here: http://langui.sh/2011/03/21/fixing-growlmail-in-10-6-7-mail-4-5/ <comment13596> @Rene @LudoMC Didn't know about the patch.... that's useful to know! <comment13645> You should rephrase your answer so that it looks like a real answer to the original question and not a reply to @Mikey's answer (even if you mention it). Anyways, thanks for the link !
