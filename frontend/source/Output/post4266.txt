AirPlay for 3rd Party apps <body> The experience I see thus far for AirPlay with 3rd party apps, on both iPhone and iPad, is that only the audio is output to the AppleTV but not the video. This is great for Pandora but not so good for any video app. Is this a bug with AirPlay or do the developers need to update their apps to support it properly?  <answer4267> According to John Gruber, this is not possible, unfortunately:     AirPlay is the killer feature for Apple TV.
