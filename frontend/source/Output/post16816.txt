Inserting links in the Pages document <body> Here is a nuisance that I'm encountering during my word processing using Apple Pages. Every time when I need to make an external link (http link) to some web page I need to make sure to edit the link field from http://livepage.apple.com/ to my desired one. Now this is not a problem if you need to do this procedure once or twice but you can imagine how frustrating this can get with more links.   I wonder if there is a preference to change this into say the one from the clipboard?  Any other suggestions on how to proceed in this case would be welcome.  <answer18996> In my experience, when you paste a link or write it out, you just need to go on typing and Pages automatically converts it to clickable text.  <comment20804> Yes, I'm aware of that feature. Thanks:)
