Speed of old Filevault vs. new Lion full disk encryption <body> How do the old Filevault and the new Lion full disk encryption compare speed wise?  ATM I am using Snow Leppard with FileVault to encrypt my whole home directory, which makes opening IPhoto, Chrome or ITunes annoyingly slow.  <answer18958> I wasn't able to find some direct comparisons but I guess you question here is really "has FileVault performance improved in Lion?". The short answer is yes. Take a look at the lion review from John Siracusa at Ars Technia to find out why. There are some regular hard drive benchmarks at the following url: http://maxcho.com/2011/07/filevault-2-benchmarks/   <answer18967> It is faster in practice when writing changes to the disk - the new block encryption is hard to measure (meaning it's a negligible slowdown).  The new implementation removes nearly all of the compacting, and delay in creating and tearing down an encrypted space. It generally allows you to continue working while the bit grinding happens in the background.  The effort to shift a whole drive to encrypted blocks happens in the background while you can still use the mac but it's no different than waiting to turn on or off the old encryption.  In practice the new is far better performing across the board and has less times when you have to wait for it to do some long operation.  <answer19358> AnandTech — Back to the Mac: OS X 10.7 Lion review: FileVault performance compares (a) performance with and without FileVault 2 — both excluding FileVault 1.   It may help to find a comparison of (b) Lion with and without FileVault 1 — both excluding FileVault 2. However: in the excitement around version 2, it may be difficult to find someone benchmarking/testing version 1 on Lion.   If both (a) and (b) can be found: read the two alongside each other.   My hunch is that stronganswers will vary, depending on what the user has in the home directory/strong.   In my case, after abandoning FileVault 1 in favour of FileVault 2 for a 318 GB startup volume in a MacBookPro5,2, the sum of the sizes of the attributes and catalog B-trees is around 4.9 GB — for a computer limited to 8 GB memory, a considerable sum:   precode[macbookpro08-centrim:~] gjp22% date Sat 30 Jul 2011 19:14:26 BST [macbookpro08-centrim:~] gjp22% uname -a Darwin macbookpro08-centrim.home 11.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 11.0.0: Sat Jun 18 12:56:35 PDT 2011; root:xnu-1699.22.73~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 [macbookpro08-centrim:~] gjp22% sudo fileXray --volume_header / # HFS+ Volume   Volume size          = 318 GB (296 GiB)  # Volume Header   signature            = 0x482b (H+)   version              = 0x4   lastMountedVersion   = 0x4846534a (HFSJ)   attributes           = 10000000000000000010000000000000                        . kHFSVolumeJournaled (volume has a journal)   journalInfoBlock     = 0x948   createDate           = Sun Apr 17 00:33:38 2011   modifyDate           = Sat Jul 30 19:14:22 2011   backupDate           = 0   checkedDate          = Sun Apr 17 08:33:38 2011   fileCount            = 6478678   folderCount          = 436279 /* not including the root folder */   blockSize            = 4096   totalBlocks          = 77592939   freeBlocks           = 10772212   nextAllocation       = 52271602   rsrcClumpSize        = 65536   dataClumpSize        = 65536   nextCatalogID        = 79803393   writeCount           = 349797840   encodingsBitmap      = 00000000000000000000000000000000                          00000010000000000000000011011111                            .

That emfeeling/em might be difficult to quantify, but I do plan to take the FileVault 1 approach, hopefully before the end of September 2011.   http://identi.ca/conversation/77065575#notice-79879336 links to an overview (work in progress) that will include performances of the two versions of FileVault alongside other considerations.
