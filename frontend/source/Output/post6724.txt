Is there any app to monitor how long has each app been actively used? <body> What I'm looking for is basically some monitoring application, which will log how long has each of my applications been actively used. By that I mean it got focus.  The point of this would be to monitor the workflow and to see where do I spend most time.  <answer6725> I believe RescueTime will do this. It will also break down your browser usage by site, which is useful too.  <answer6741> I've used Active Timer for this in the past.  Wakoopa will do it as well, but you can't get a very detailed breakdown.
