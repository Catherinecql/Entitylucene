How to move Lion installer to another Mac? <body> I installed Lion on my MacBook Pro.  Worked great.  Now I want to install it on my iMac, I don't want to re-download it from the App Store because it's a 3.5GB download and I have to pay for all my bandwidth (yes, I'm Canadian).  Is the installer executable on my MacBook Pro somewhere?  If so, where is it and can I just copy it to the iMac and run it?  Thanks, Rob  <answer18060> Unfortunately the installer is removed after a successful installation of Lion, so you'll probably need to download it again.  <answer18061> Unfortunately the installer package contains the source files for the installation and this package is deleted once installation has completed.  If you still have the installer in Applications, right-click on it and Show Package Contents then browse to the /Contents/SharedSupport/ folder and look for the InstallESD.dmg disk image. This image can be burnt to a dvd saving future downloads but I am afraid you are going to have to download it again.   <answer18068> As described here, you can save a copy prior to install: http://www.cultofmac.com/save-your-bandwidth-prevent-os-x-lion-installer-from-self-destructing/105470  <answer18097> From another question....  Is it possible to burn a DVD out of the Lion app store install?   Joel has a nice set of instructions on how to do this.
