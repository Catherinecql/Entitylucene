Where is the video my sister sent to me on iMessage? I clicked save and can't find it <body> I have an iPhone 3GS.  I just did the software update to iOS5.  My sister took a cute video of my kid and sent it to me on iMessage.  I tried to save it to my phone so I could upload it to the computer and/or facebook, and now I can't find it.  It is not in my camera roll or in my iCloud.  So the question is....where is the file and why can't i find it?  <answer29028> Check in your 'Videos' app; it should be saved in there.  <comment33349> just checked.
