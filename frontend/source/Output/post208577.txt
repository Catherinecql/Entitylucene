Automating numbers, Exporting the file as an excel document <body> I have recently acquired a Macbook Pro (OS X Yosemite 10.10.4). I find the Numbers application satisfactory to work with, but I save the file as an .xlsx file after I am done. I need to make changes to the file repeatedly and save it repeatedly as the file is used as input by a program that can only read excel files.  As a consequence, every time I make a change in the file I have to go to the Menu bar, pick export as Excel, choose to replace the pre-existing excel file. I have gone through some tutorials of applescript used for 'Numbers', but I cannot find out how to automate the process of exporting a file as Excel.  precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "Numbers"         activate         tell document 1             export as xlsx         end tell     end tell     return input end run /code/pre  This is the code as it stands. Please let me know how to automate the process of exporting a numbers file as an excel file.  <answer212532> I've written a script to export to CSV originally. I've included a commented out line in that script you can switch to, to export to Excel instead:  See the gist here: https://gist.github.com/idStar/61994506d69595da3d30  Additionally, the entire script is reproduced below:  precode#! /usr/bin/osascript  (* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Script: SpreadsheetExportToCSV   Command-line tool to convert a spreadsheet document to CSV  This AppleScript is tested with and compatible with Apple iWork Numbers 3.6,  current as at October 23, 2015.

Part of this is in the ability for  Numbers to correctly process UTF8 formatting when exporting.   Setup default export encoding for CSV files to UTF8, so without   specifying anything further for AppleScript, the right format will   be applied automatically. Since we cannot specify the CSV export  encoding via AppleScript, we will set it via the Defaults Database  with a shell command.   Here are the codes that apply: 4=UTF8, 12=windows latin, 30=MacRoman  As such, we'll specify 4 for UTF8.
