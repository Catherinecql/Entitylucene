OS X menubar/dashboard/dock utility for monitoring a server? <body> Is there any desktop utility for OS X that would periodically monitor a (non-osx) server and display a status icon?  Something as simple as attempting to visit a URL every 5 minutes and turning red if it does not respond would be enough, although anything more detailed is interesting too.  <answer8907> h2ServerSiren ($15 with 10 day free trial)/h2     With Server Siren, server downtime is a thing of the past. It runs as a menu bar item, so a quick glance is all it takes to see that everything is A-OK. If a server goes down, Server Siren alerts you immediately so you can fix the problem and get your site up and running again.   <answer8909> h2GeekTool (free)/h2  GeekTool will let you set up a simple icon or show more detailed information, embedded in or floating over your desktop, based on whatever programming you want.   If you can write a script to check the server and return either a binary status or more detailed information, GeekTool is the way to display it.  <comment9446> Do you only intend to ever be watching 1 site? And *all* you want to know is reachable or not? <comment9448> Also: What medium are you monitoring? Is ping enough? Are you checking accessibility of a website? SSH? <comment9478> Unfortunately this one doesn't work with OS X = 10.5 (I'm on Snow Leopard) <comment9479> That does the trick, esp. since I can set it always on top and then place it on top of the menu bar.
