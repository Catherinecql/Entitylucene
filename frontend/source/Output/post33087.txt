Device enrollment fails, error: server certificate is invalid <body> I have an Xserve running 10.7.2 Server fully patched today.  We have a valid SSL from GoDaddy installed.  Lion's firewall is off, hardware firewall is not blocking any traffic.  From an iPad I can access the profile manager through the webpage https://mydomain.com/profilemanager and log in successfully.  I can install the Trust Profile successfully.  When I try enroll the device it gives me this error:  The server certificate for "https://mydomain.com/devicemanagement/api/device/ota_service" is invalid  <answer33148> This issue is resolved.  When installing the SSL cert from GoDaddy in Lion server there are two items that need to take place outlined in GoDaddy's guide for OS X Server 10.6:  ol liInstall Intermediate Chain/li liInstall Certificate/li /ol  The Intermediate Chain had not been completed and thus the Certificate was from showing as coming from an unsigned authority. Once the Intermediate Chain had been installed I was able to successfully enroll the device.  <comment40995> I'm having this same exact issue (including Godaddy Cert). The problem is that after reading this, I installed the intermediate chain cert, rebooted the box, and am still having issues. I **CAN** enroll my Macbook Pro, but I can't enroll my iOS devices (iPhone and iPad). Thoughts?
