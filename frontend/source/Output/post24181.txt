What Does A "There is a user sharing this computer..." Window Mean? <body> I was trying to turn off my Macbook Pro and suddenly got this message. As far as I know, there's no reason why this should be happening. Anyone want to fill me in on some possibilities?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VEtuC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer24189> Apparently, you've enabled File Sharing in the Sharing section of System Preferences. Someone on your network has connected to your computer, either as a registered user or as a guest.   Unless this kind of access is absolutely required, it's good security practice to disable both File Sharing and the Guest user in System Preferences - Sharing and System Preferences - Accounts and Groups, respectively.  <comment27121> For Lion, it was in "Users & Groups" under "System" and "Sharing" under "Internet & Wireless" in the System Preferences. Thanks though. It's much appreciated.
