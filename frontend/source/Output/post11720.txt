Can the mid-2010 Macbook be used with the Apple Remote? <body> I know that the remote works with units that have an IR sensor. The system profile has listings for hardware that both is and is not installed but, I don't see a listing for an IR unit.  <answer11722> Starting 2010 it is only the Macbook Pro's that support IR.  The last Macbook that supported IR was the 13" mid 2009, and the last Macbook Air was mid 2009  <comment12279> Thank you! I wasn't sure since I've seen some models with concealed sensors.
