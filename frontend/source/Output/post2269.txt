Where can I learn about programming my Jail broken iOS device? <body> I'd like to do some R&amp;D pushing the boundaries of iOS devices. Is there a how-to guide or private API documentation?  Is there a Stack Exchange site for this?  <answer2270> There is a Stack Exchange proposal but it's lacking support:     [...]for iOS developers who require   help and advice when using   undocumented iOS APIs. Developers who   discover private iOS APIs and need a   place to document them.   http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/18154/ios-private-apis  <comment81637> Note that the linked proposal is now closed.
