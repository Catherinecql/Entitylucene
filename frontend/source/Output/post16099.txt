Is there a way to pickup iPhone calls on my Macbook Pro? <body> I have my iPhone headset plugged into my Macbook Pro so that I can listen to some proper music and have my Iphone 4 lying next to my MB Pro.  Now, of course, it would be really emreally/em fancy if there was a way I could proxy my incoming iPhone calls to my MB Pro via Bluetooth (essentially turning my MB Pro into a bluetooth headset) so that I can still pick up calls with my iPhone headset, even though it is plugged into my MB Pro.  strongIs there a way to do this?/strong  <answer16103> As of June 2011, BluePhoneElite was providing this feature, supporting a great range of mobile phones, but it became abandonware! :(  Their website is suggesting Phone Amego as an alternative. It may worth to check it out.  <answer132634> This is a feature apple brought with the lastest OS X : OS X Yosemite.   OS X Yosemite is still a beta and will be released publicly in fall 2014.   <comment22343> I checked out Phone Amego, but found it to be *really* poorly designed software, almost to the state that it is unusable. The interface is really lacking and I have not actually gotten it to work as well. Thanks for the tip, though!
