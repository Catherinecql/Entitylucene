How can I fix the GPS problem that occured after jailbreaking iPhone 3GS 4.2.1? <body> I have an iPhone 3GS (old bootrom) and updated to 4.2.1 via iTunes a few days ago. Then I jailbreaked it via redsn0w 0.9.6b6. I only marked the option to install Cydia, nothing else (i.e. I didn't updated the baseband to 6.15.00; in settings on the iPhone, it says I have 5.15.04).  Now, it seems that GPS is not working anymore. Why? How can I fix it?  If there is not really a way to fix it, what are the options? In any case, I must have GPS working and I must have the jailbreak.  Downgrade to 4.2 somehow? Or reset it somehow?  <answer5941> You'll need a copy of your old SHSH blobs. If you don't have it, I don't believe you will be able to downgrade.  If you have your old blobs, grab a copy of the older firmware and follow various guides  <comment6655> if you have the copy @Albert, this is **the** guide: http://thebigboss.org/jailbreak-now <comment6670> @Cawas - that link doesn't answer his question on how to downgrade or fix his GPS issue. <comment6674> I meant to jailbreak, so he know which best version to downgrade to.
