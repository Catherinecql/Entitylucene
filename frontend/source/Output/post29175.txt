Transfer video file from OS X Lion to iPod touch 4th gen with iOS 5 <body> I have a recently purchased MacBook Pro with Lion and I want to transfer a video file to my iPod touch. The only problem is this is not the Mac with which my iPod touch library is synced, so I cannot really use iTunes sync feature. What can I do?  <answer29179> If you're looking for a workaround here, you might be able to use Dropbox. Store the file in your Dropbox account on your Mac, download the iOS client, and star the file as a favorite on your iPod touch. I believe that will cache it on the iPod touch. Then, when you click it, it should play.  You will need a wireless internet connection for the Touch on the first sync, but once it's starred as a favorite, it should be accessible even when offline.  <answer29181> Air Sharing will provide a network drive the Mac can drop files onto so you can view them on your touch.  <comment33530> will it use network traffic. I mean outside my LAN. <comment33531> I am aware of this workaround but I was more specifically looking for a non-internet thing, the one I can do without internet connection. <comment33539> As long as both the MacBook and the iDevice are in the same LAN/WLAN they should be able to connect just fine.
