Is there a secure shell client for Mac similar to Secure CRT for Windows? <body> I have many servers to manage and I don't want to use Terminal on my Mac to keep and manage server lists.  I want to know if there is a secure shell client for Mac similar to Secure CRT on Windows?  <answer26798> I haven't used it, but it looks like JellyfiSSH might do what you're looking for. $4 on the Mac App store. There's also SSHMenu which looks less polished, but you can get it for free if you want to compile it yourself, or $1 on the App store.  <answer26803> How about SecureCRT for Mac? http://www.vandyke.com/products/beta/securecrt/mac_osx.html  <answer26813> What about Tagged Profiles of iTerm2?  <answer39152> I use iTerm2 in the way I used to use SecureCRT. In particular, if you set up profiles then you can pick machines off a list and have a single button click / hotkey open up a shell on the chosen remote machine. To set up a profile this way:  ol liRun iTerm2 and select Profiles / Open Profiles./li liClick "Edit Profiles" to bring up the Preferences pane./li liClick the + button in lower left to create a new profile./li liName your profile however you want, like the remote hostname./li liClick the Command radio button, and set the command to codessh [hostname]/code./li li(Optional) configure other options for just this profile, like colors, terminal behavior, etc. You can also set a shortcut key./li /ol  Now when you want to log in to your remote machine, just select Open Profiles (or press Cmd-O) and click your machine name. There are buttons to open the session in a new tab or new window.  Technically this is a little different than SecureCRT; it's not sshing directly from iTerm2, it creates a tty on your local machine first and runs the ssh command in it. That design is harmless and in many ways a virtue; you get Keychain integration for your ssh credentials, for instance.  <answer93357> I'm a great fan of ZOC Terminal Emulator for MacOS.     It has a host list, tabbed interface, very similar features (the two programs (ZOC and SecCRT) appear to copy-cat each other's features always within a few months).  Like SecureCRT it is commercial.  See also this question/answer on superuser (the guy there quotes someone saying it's the closest thing to SecureCRT).  User comments on MacUpdate are mostly favorable.  .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dTlEG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment44313> I use profiles in iTerm2 much the same way. As a way to do one click ssh access to different hosts.
