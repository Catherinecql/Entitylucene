Is there a way to number list items in reverse order in Pages '09? <body> I want to create an ordered list in Pages '09 with decreasing numbers, like:  precode4. Most Recent Item, 2010. 3. Another Item, 2009. 2. An Old Item, 2008. 1. Oldest Item, 2007. /code/pre  But it looks like there is no option to do this, but prefix items with numbers manually myself.  Does anyone know how to do this automatically with Pages '09?  <answer4213> Nope, you can only tell Pages to start at a number, and it will add +1 to that number. Pages ’09 doesn’t have the option to perform a reverse numbered list.  However, a “workaround” exists by using an old school table.  ol liClick on the table icon on the toolbar to create a table.  /li liResize the table to your preferred size (Inspector  Table  Table: for better control on the cell’s size)./li liYou will need two columns, the first column will be for the “numbers” and the second one will be the item itself. /li liType the highest number in the 1st column/first row and the next number in the first column, second row. (see image)/li liDrag the little white dot downwards and the sequence will be automatically completed. /li liModify the table properties in the inspector to remove the borders. /li liSilently grin because nobody will know this is a table… you can make evil sounds too./li /ol  If you need more emrows/em later, you can add them, modify the first two items in the “sequence” and re-drag to regenerate the emnew/em sequence, for the same price.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5gYq7.jpg" alt="Table"  strongAdditional Info/strong  This “automcomplete the secuence” magic also works for other datatypes, for example: Letters (try a, b, … drag).   strong8.
