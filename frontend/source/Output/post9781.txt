iPhone Application for Email Address Shortcut <body> Does anybody know of an iPhone application or shortcut that allows you to save your email address access it via a shortcut?  This would be super useful when filling in forms in Safari or in when your email address is required in an application.  <answer9782> An excellent application for shortcuts is Smile Software's TextExpander touch. Because of limitations in iOS, it doesn't work to expand shortcuts in every app (including, sadly, all of Apple's apps). From the manufacturer's site:     Given the current feature set of the   iPhone OS, TextExpander touch cannot   work in the background (as it does in   Mac OS X), expanding text snippets   while you work in other apps, except   for apps with TextExpander-integration   built-in. You must first compose your   text in the TextExpander touch Compose   screen, and then transfer it to   another app.   <answer9792> If you are willing to jailbreak, Action Menu does what you are looking for. I have put my e-mail address in the favorites tab of that program and I can now reach it anywhere.  <comment10297> I'd advice for Action Menu as well. And I doubt there's any software able to do the request without jailbreaking.
