Can the Epson V700 be used with an Airport <body> I have a MacBook Pro, Snow Leopard, and an Epson V700 Scanner.  I'm thinking of buying an Airport Extreme or even better, an Airport Express (cos it's cheap).  Can I use the Epson V700 via the Airport as if it was connected locally via USB?  Apple talks about printers but not dedicated scanner, any ideas...?  cheers!  <answer6597> You emcannot/em scan over the network using the USB port of the airport express. It is only for printing.  Apple does not explicitly say that emscanners are not supported/em, but it is not one of the official uses of the USB hub. I have not heard anyone being successful in this, and AFAIK there are no hacks/third party s/w to do this (like AirFoil for streaming audio).  I personally have tried, in vain. I have a HP all in one, but the Snow Leopard does not recognize the scanner functions. I have to physically connect the scanner for this to work.
