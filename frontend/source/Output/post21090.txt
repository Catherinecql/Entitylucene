How do we set OS X Lion sync to show warning before data on computer is changed? <body> In the past we used to have to go to iSync preferences but iSync has been completely removed in OS X Lion. Any ideas?  I would personally prefer a warning before strongany/strong data is changed on my computer, on account of issues such as Snow Leopard used to "support" Google Contacts sync but would remove all nicknames from your contacts.  <answer21235> The best you can do is set sync to manual mode.  It is expected that some sync operations will delete data. I don't know of a good publish/subscribe solution, so just be sure to watch and have good, regular backups.  <answer21304> If you still have your snapshot backup of your OSX Snow Leopard before you upgraded to Lion (you did backup didn't you?), then there is a solution to getting iSync back up and working under Lion :  slashusr.wordpress.com  Extract follows :     Before installation of Lion, I had taken a full disk image of my   previous Snow Leopard installation using the excellent SuperDuper!   Disk cloner.      This was more from a backup and recovery perspective, but allowed me   an unexpected solution to the iSync quandary – on a whim, I attached   the Snow Leopard disk to the Mac running Lion, and clicked on the   iSync application. Voila! iSync works exactly as it should!   Hope this helps.
