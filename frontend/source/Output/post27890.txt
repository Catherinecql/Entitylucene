How do I get Siri to make an event on a Gmail or Exchange calendar? <body> I can get Siri to show me events on my Google Apps calendar (which I have set up as an Exchange account, to get the benefits of push email), but I can't get her to make an event on that calendar; new events keep being created on my own calendar.  <answer27892> Change your default calendar under Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars. It's near the bottom.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iSxou.png" alt="enter image description here"
