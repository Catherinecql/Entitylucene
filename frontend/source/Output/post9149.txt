Can Apple delete an app installed via iTunes or the App Store without your permission? <body> I had always thought the answer to this was no. I have an app that was pulled from the iOS App Store (VLC) still on my non-jailbroken phone and thought this was proof that Apple can't remote wipe an app. But I just heard a claim that they emcan/em remote wipe apps installed via their app purchase portals if they choose.  Is this true? True for just iOS apps or just App Store apps?  <answer9151> I think it might be possible.  You never know until it happens. If I were in a company that screened all sold applications so closely, then I'd keep the option available. Someone could slip a harmful app through the screening process, and if you could remote wipe all the bad apps, then you wouldn't loose rep for it. :D  But as you say yourself, they haven't deleted apps like VLC, I have it too on my iOS.  Besides, if you sync apps to your itunes, you always have a hard copy of them in your iTunes library, so don't know if wiping would help :D  <answer9152> Yes, it's true Apple strongcan/strong remotely delete apps. This is a failsafe in case a nefarious app accidentally makes it past the review process. Not sure about Mac App store, I doubt the ability exists there. It's a different installation/update process.  I don't think it's been done before, and I wouldn't worry about it. It's a good thing. I would want an app that say sniffs my credit card numbers or is actually a trojan horse of some kind to be removed from my iPhone post haste.  <comment9711> +1 for link and sharing the rationale. <comment57892> you should not confuse 'remotely delete an app' and 'remove an app from sale' <comment57893> you should not confuse 'remotely delete an app' and 'remove an app from sale'
