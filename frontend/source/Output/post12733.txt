MacBook not detecting external display <body> I have an old MacBook 1.1 and since I upgraded to Mac OS X 10.6 it does not seem to connect to my external Monitor or TV. I'm using the Mini-DVI to VGA adapter. I've tried using detect displays and made sure the monitor is outputting through VGA.   The strange thing is I have my MacBook set up to dual boot into Ubuntu and I can use the external monitor when in Ubuntu. It seems to be software issue on the Mac OS X side.   Can anyone suggest any troubleshooting steps?  <answer14106> Try resetting the PRAM: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379  <comment13391> Software update?  Sounds like it might be a driver issue.
