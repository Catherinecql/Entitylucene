How can I make Time Machine work with my Netgear WNDR3700 router? <body> The story is this:  I just upgraded to Mac OS Lion and as it turns out it won't work with my Samba share in the way Snow Leopard used to, for TimeMachine backups. After a bit of Googling I found that this is because TimeMachine now requires NetTalk 2.2 and AFP. So my question is this: How do I get an AFP share to work on my router? I currently use DD-WRT but I've had no luck installing custom software to it, recall it having something to do with there not being a package manager for the architecture used in the router I have.  I don't mind reflashing the router to either original firmware, if anyone can confirm that works, or some other firmware such as Tomato.  <answer19482> Look at http://netatalk-ddwrt.blogspot.com/   Try the builds mentioned and install them on your router with the following commands:  ipkg install libdb_4.7.25-3_mipsel.ipk ipkg install netatalk_2.2.0-2_mipsel.ipk  make sure that you use  ipkg install libdb_4.7.25-3_mipsel.ipk -force-downgrade  in case your libdb version is newer than 4.7.24.
