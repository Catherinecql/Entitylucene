My globe keys gone <body> My younger sister plays with my iphone4 and at one point I thought I had a globe key and realized I don't. How can I get it back or is there a way to get one for my phone?  <answer30668> Probably she's deactivated a keyboard that you had previously activated. If you want to get it back, go to Settings - General - Keyboard - International Keyboards and add whichever you need.
