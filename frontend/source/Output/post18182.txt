Use widgets on Desktop Lion <body> How can I use my widgets on the desktop in Lion? I have done   precodedefaults write com.apple.dashboard demoed yes /code/pre  But, when I click and hold and hit dashboard, it stays on the dashboard. How can I use widgets on my desktop in Lion? @Nathan, how did you do it? I talked to you earlier about it...  <answer19149> YEah! I found the solution.  Turn Off “Dashboard as a Space” head to System Preferences  Mission Control.  Uncheck the “Show Dashboard as a space” box and you’ll have the widgets back.  Then again you can go to terminal en type in: defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES hit return/enter then type in: killall Dock (mind the capital D in Dock) That's it!  <comment21509> Cool! Thanks a ton!
