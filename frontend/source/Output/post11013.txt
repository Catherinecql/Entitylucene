Multiple skype instances on iphone <body> Is is possible to run multiple instances of skype client on an iphone.  I would like to be able to to login to two separate skype accounts and have the run simultaneously.   Is it possible?  For instance, if there was an unofficial skype client, I could install it along the official one with different user name.  <answer11014> Not possible with the official Skype App.   Running unofficial Skype client is possible, but recently Skype changed the rules and pushed out third parties, running Skype gateways (like Fring).  <comment11592> just out of curiosity: why?
