iOS MobileMe Sync <body> Hey does anyone know if there is a public framework to sync data between iOS devices using MobileMe?  I've tried googling it and have come up empty.  <answer619> Basically, you could use MobileMe as a WebDAV server to sync your data OTA.  This is, for example, what Wallet uses.  <answer622> I don't believe that there is yet. Apple have a MobileMe SDK on the desktop, but haven't released anything for iOS as yet. And if memory serves, I can't recall having seen any iOS apps that use MobileMe for syncing, beyond the built-in Calendar, AddressBook and Notes apps.  <comment582> Ya, that's was I though, too.
