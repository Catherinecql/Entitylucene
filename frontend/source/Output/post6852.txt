What app can I use to create mockups for websites?  <body> I'm looking for a free or commercial software for Os X to create mockups for websites. Any suggestion?  <answer6853> Balsamiq Mockups is a good one, fairly cheap and very good - http://balsamiq.com/  <answer6867> For mocking up websites I swear by Adobe Fireworks, it might be overkill, but the abilty to have a library of buttons etc and set a master page that carries elements to all the other pages, so headers/footers etc only need to be changed once.  <answer6899> You can do all sorts of fun things with Omnigraffle as well. And if you're looking for a way to make easy wireframes of current websites, you might do worse than checking out Wirify. Good luck!  <answer6902> Check out frame box—a "lightweight online tool for creating mockups."  <answer6907> Depending on the definition of "mockup", you might be interested in DENIM.     DENIM is a system that helps web site   designers in the early stages of   design. DENIM supports sketching   input, allows design at different   refinement levels, and unifies the   levels through zooming.   <answer18200> WireframeSketcher is a cross-platform rapid wireframing tool.  <answer18232> Just In Mind is probably one of the most extensive commercial website mockup apps, and Mockingbird is a fairly lightweight online mockup tool.  If you use Firefox 3, take a look at Pencil, a free wireframe sketching add-on. A version for Firefox 4 is available here, but I haven't tried it.  <answer122208> You may try SwordSoft Layout. It also available on the App Store  <comment19918> The only downside of this app is, it is based on Adobe AIR. Sometime it gets your nerve (Like blocking the shutdown sequence). Otherwise, quite a neat mockup tool! <comment142584> Please summarize, the URL might die. <comment281166> Related: [Software for Website Mockups (Win/Linux)](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/q/12044/3474), [Web-based interaction tool for mockups](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/q/3039/3474) at SR.SE
