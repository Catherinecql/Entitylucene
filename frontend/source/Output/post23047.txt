Share favorites in Firefox using Bootcamp? <body> I'm using BootCamp to install Windows 7 on my Mac. On both OS I'm using Firefox 6. Is there an easy way to automatically share the favorites in both OS?  <answer23048> If you're running Firefox 4 or higher, you can use Firefox's built-in sync capabilities to keep multiple instances of Firefox in sync across different operating systems and machines.  C|Net has a nice video that shows you how to set it up.  <answer23093> I guess you can use the Xmarks service. It can sync between multiple browsers: Firefox, Chrome and even Safari in Mac.
