Move Developer Folder <body> I want to free some space on my SSD.  Is there a way to move the Developer folder from my root drive to another one without breaking anything?  <answer31969> It might not hurt anything, or it might. A better (if more time-consuming) solution might be to delete your existing Developer folder, then re-install the dev tools to the drive you want them to be on. This will ensure that everything that has to be in code/Developer/code is there.  <answer31977> Some files in the /Developer path are referenced when you launch specific functions within  Xcode. If you need to recover space and absolutely has to move /Developer, you could try  ul liMove the /Developer folder to the alternate path and symlink it so that Xcode still finds it at /. Note: I haven't tried it with Xcode 4.x, so please share if this works./li lialternative is to do a clean uninstall using 'sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools' and custom reinstall Xcode by specifying a different path./li /ul  <comment76175> Using a symlink appears to work fine -- I just did it, browsed several topics, etc.
