Coda folder sorting <body> Does anybody know if there's an option in Coda somewhere (or a hack) that would sort folders at the top of the list in the file browsers?  <answer8725> I don't know if that option exists, but if you send the question to @panic on twitter or better yet email support@panic.com, they'll respond and let you know.   <answer10568> I suspect that the File Browser sidebar is a standard Cocoa Widget. What this means is that it would follow all the same rules that standard OSX applications do (think: Finder).  Since the Finder does not show Folders first, Coda will probably not have a way to show Folder first.  I second Kris + Matthew B.'s answer, that Panic is a great company that answers users' questions. Having said that, don't get your hopes up, because Coda is just behaving exactly like the Finder does.
