CSS error in Safari, pages won't load <body> So recently I updated to OS El Capitan 10.11.2 and it has interfered with my Safari experience (I think). I am somehow not able to see any pages in my Google Drive (Docs, Slides, Sheets), but I can use every other site perfectly fine. I have tried force quitting, clearing history, but it hasn't fixed the problem.  I don't know if clearing the caches will fix it though.  When I open the error console in Safari it states the below about 14 times, then Safari reloads saying: "A problem occurred with this web page so it was reloaded." It will do this for forever until the tab is closed.  Invalid CSS property declaration at: *  At the moment the sites: Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings don't work. And I am sure this problem is isolated to my machine since I can access those sites on other computers.  Also I have tried booting up in safe mode but I still can't access the sites.  Additional INFO:  OS X El Capitan 10.11.2  Safari Ver: 9.0.2  Macbook Pro (mid 2009)
