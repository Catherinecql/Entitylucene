iPod Touch 4th Gen dock with AC or USB power and audio out? <body> I have scoured the internet looking for a dock that will allow me to charge an iPod Touch 4supth/sup Gen which includes a jack to connect it to an external stereo system.  I understand this can be accomplished with a standard USB charging cable (plugged into a USB-AC converter) and a male-to-male audio cable, but I'd like a classier way of docking the iPod.  <answer4847> The Apple Universal Dock provides both a 30 pin connector for charging and/or syncing as well as a 3.5mm audio output jack.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g9dnz.png" alt="alt text"  <comment4806> Thanks, that is perfect.  Not sure how I missed that.
