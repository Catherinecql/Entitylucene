Does Migration Assistant migrate macports? <body> New MacBook Pro here.  I am about to use Migration Assistant to copy over my old files from my old first-gen MacBook.  Will I have to reinstall macports manually or will Migration Assistant copy my /opt directory?      <answer11208> The copying should work without a problem, but if you happen to upgrade to Snow Leopard at the same time, you might run into some compatibility issues, depending on the "ports" you have installed. Same goes for old "ports" that may have been specifically built for your old system (maybe processor dependent), you could run into problems there, too.   Remember to run codeselfupdate/code, and codeupgrade/code the installed ports (where needed).
