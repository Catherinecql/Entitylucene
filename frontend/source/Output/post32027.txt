Where did my "Default Group" preference go? <body> In iOS 4.x.x, I remember having a preference in:  Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  Contacts  that would allow me to select a Default Group.  Now that I've upgraded to iOS 5, that preference is no longer visible.  Was it removed?  Moved?  Do I have to have a specific setup in order to have that preference available?  I need to select a "Default Group" in order to reproduce a bug reported by a beta tester, so it'd be handy to be able to set this preference.  <answer44966> In iOS 5.1, you can define a "Default Account" for Contacts in Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars.  Scroll down until you see a Contacts heading; Default Account is at the bottom of that section. This setting will affect where new Contacts created on the iPhone are placed.  <comment36717> Was the bug reported by a beta tester not yet on iOS 5? <comment36724> Actually, the weird thing is that it was reported by someone on iOS 5.  In their settings, they had the option to set a "Default Group" for their Contacts, but I don't. <comment51185> awesome, looks like it came back in 5.1!
