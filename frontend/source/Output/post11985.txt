ImageMagick Errors while installing dependencies <body> I'm using this script: https://github.com/maddox/magick-installer  to install imagemagick and it's dependencies i have a few errors the first run for some missing files or borken links but now i have all this solved.... but when it's installing the libpng, i think, the scrip stops and trow this error:  codeln: ./libtool: File exists/code  i don't know what to do, seems like the first run it created some symlink somewhere and not it found this symlink and stops the script.  thanks.  <answer12003> Try installing ImageMagick with HomeBrew   https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew  Once installed just type   precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  This will download any dependancies, compile the source and install it.
