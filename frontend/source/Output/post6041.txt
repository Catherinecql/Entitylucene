Is it possible to use Image Capture to scan over WiFi with an EPSON SX620FW, and how to set that up? <body> I'm wondering whether it's possible to use Image Capture to scan over WiFi with my EPSON All-in-One SX620FW? If so, how can I set it up?  I've found instructions from someone claiming it works with their EPSON PX710W, but I haven't been able to replicate these. I can scan without problems over WiFi using the bundled EPSON Scan application, but am wondering if and how I could use Image Capture instead.  <answer6061> I've got an NX420, and I can use the scanner with Image Capture over WiFi. What did it for me was eminstalling the drivers that came on the CD/em (the ones Apple included didn't do it, and neither did the ones on the Epson website).  You might try that.  <answer6402> Software Update provided me with an update for EPSON printers today and now I can use my EPSON SX620FW to scan over WiFi with Image Capture, no additional setup needed (apart from adding the device in the Print&amp;Fax system preferences panel)!  The update is also available through Apple's website:  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL900
