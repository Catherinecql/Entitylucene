My Developer Account cannot be activated because I used a relative's credit card <body> So now I have an "identity cannot be verified" message whenever I activate it from the activation code Apple gave me via email.  Is there anything I can do about this or is my $99 "doomed"?  <answer16969> You will have to get in touch with Apple and perhaps they will ask your relative to call, because they will want to make sure that you didn't "steal" the credit card. Other than that, you're not "doomed" in any way.   <answer16970> From the iOS Developer Program Support:     If I enroll as an Individual in the Standard program can I use someone else’s credit card to purchase the Program?      The billing information provided for   the purchase must exactly match the   Program enrollment information. If   this information does not match your   enrollment will be delayed and you   will be asked to provide a notarized   copy of a government issued   identification.   I would contact support and ask them what to do next.  <answer16971> I have used other individual's credit cards for this purpose.  You should have no problem after phoning Developer Support Hotline http://developer.apple.com/contact/phone.html  Occasionally it gets stuck for no apparent reason that Apple could explain.  Happened to a client of mine yesterday.  We phoned and all was made well in minutes.  <comment18437> email apple support. they should be able to help you. <comment18490> what will I tell them when I phone them? <comment18538> Tell them your identity cannot be verified but all your details are complete.  They will be able to see if there are any discrepancies on your account. Normally they wave a magic wand and it proceeds.
