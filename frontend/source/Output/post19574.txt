Why does my MacBook Pro take so long to go to sleep? <body> Until recently, when I pressed kbdOption/kbd-kbdCmd/kbd-kbdEject/kbd, my MacBook Pro used to go to sleep almost immediately (e.g. within three or four seconds). It's a MBP 8,2 with an SSD and 8GB RAM.  Since a week or so, it takes much longer; around fifteen seconds or even more. Here's the console output from pressing the keyboard shortcut until the kernel's codesleep/code message:  precode7/31/11 11:50:59 PM mDNSResponder[17]   Client application bug: DNSServiceResolve(charon._smb._tcp.local.) active for over two minutes.

Considering that codePMStats/code reports a hibernation write time of over eight seconds, this leads me into thinking it is the RAM content.  The only system changes I remember are installing the two updates for 10.6 that came out just before Lion's final release. Did that change anything?  How would I go about troubleshooting this?  hr  Even after  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 1 /code/pre  it takes roughly the same time to sleep.  hr  FYI, here's the information from a "clean" (non-safe) sleep:  precode8/1/11 2:26:49 PM   kernel  AirPort: Link Down on en1.

Exactly. Your RAM contents are written to the disk, in the default sleep mode, called "Safe sleep", which takes longer the more RAM you have. You can modify this with the PMSet command in terminal.   precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 /code/pre  and then reboot.  If you disable this option, you can also remove the sleepimage file from code/var/vm/code, and reclaim 8GB of hard disk space. Do note that you will lose data then if you sleep for too long and the battery dies.   <answer20431> I used to have an episode of slow boot, shutdown, sleep and hibernate. When I turn on verbose mode during boot-up, it was stuck at "Waiting for DSMOS" for a long time. See this link. To solve it, see this link.  Thereafter, all my slow-downs were gone.  <answer52834> Do you by any chance have a firewire device plugged in? If I try to sleep my Macpro (tower) with an older iSight camera plugged in via Firewire, it takes 10-20 seconds to sleep, vs the normal 2-3.  <comment21469> `sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0` (as suggested in the other question) did not change anything though. Still the same sleep times (about 15 seconds). <comment21472> Odd, did you reboot? And did you delete the sleep image? If you run `pmset -g | grep hibernate mode`, does it show 0? There's also that "smart sleep" app. <comment21473> It should be `grep hibernatemode`, but it is set to 1 anyway. No sleep image to be found. I'll try rebooting now. <comment21474> Thanks. Also the sleepimage is in /var/vm <comment21476> Removing the sleep image won't likely help other than th be sure it didn't get recreated after the reboot ( an indirect way of making sure pmset worked) <comment21477> Now (after the reboot) it worked -- still I'm a bit confused. Why didn't it take that long in the beginning? Some setting must have changed. <comment21478> Have you tried a reboot after `pmset` to ensure the writing a sleepimage change takes effect? For most, waiting for 8g of ram contents to sync to disk causes the delay. Do post the system.log messages for a non safe sleep timings as well - might help <comment21482> Either your SSD has less free space and can't write 8G of files cleanly or your ram has more interesting things in it now. Yu also could have more apps that do things in anticipation of a sleep event. Your mac just might have more to clean up. <comment21486> I updated it. Having 45GB available and never taking more space than that, it doesn't seem like a performance thing (haven't had performance issues with the SSD yet). I think 5GB of memory were in use though. <comment22561> Shutting down and booting is fine actually, it's only the safe sleep that's being slow. Thanks though, I'll read through it! <comment60433> For me that wasn't the case, but good to know! <comment64781> This is relevant: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/56432/chrome-prevents-sleeping
