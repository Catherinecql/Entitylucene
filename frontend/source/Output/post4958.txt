Connecting a MacBook Pro to a Windows ad hoc network <body> I'm trying to share my wired ethernet connection from my Windows 7 laptop with my MacBook Pro (running 10.6.5). I've just set it up to be an open network; no encryption. I'm pretty sure I set up the ad hoc network correctly, it's broadcasting, and I can connect to the network on the mac.   The catch is that the network shows up under the "Devices" part of the menu, rather than the main networks area. I can't browse to any websites, nor connect to the Windows box via samba. The IP assigned is a 169.254 one.  Is there some setting somewhere that I missed to get this to work correctly? Do I need to manually set this up some how? Here are my network settings: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PTP0l.png" alt="Connection Woe"  <answer4960> You've set up the connection correctly, but it looks like you haven't set the Windows machine to allow other computers on the ad-hoc network to access the internet. Here are the steps you need (shamelessly taken from this blog post):  emNote:/em I assume that you have ensured that the Windows machine is connected to the internet through some non-wireless method. If not, you definitely need to do that first, otherwise there's nothing to share.  ol liClick on the Windows icon, and type codeView network connections/code and press enter./li liIdentify the wired internet connection and the wireless card. Locate the wired internet connection and right click on it. Select Properties./li liClick on the Sharing tab. Make sure the box codeAllow other users to connect through this computer's internet connection/code is checked./li /ol  <answer55694> For anyone else having this problem, I would recommend an application like Connectify (free and paid versions available).  I had a similar problem connecting both an iPod Touch and a Nokia WLAN capable cell phone to a Ad-hoc network from a Windows 7 laptop. After installing and setting up Connectify in Access Point I was able to connect successfully with the iPod Touch. (The Nokia could now at least see the network, but connection failed.)

Set router ip to ad hoc's ip: 192.168.137.1.  <answer181161> Go to system preferences  network  advanced  TCP/IP tab  on configure IPv4 dropdown click on Manually and set IPv4 address to 192.168.X.X and that will help you connect to internet.  <comment5036> Tried that. Got the same thing, a 169.254.x.x address and no actual network connectivity. <comment63809> Did you find a solution here? <comment63838> Sort of... I ended up dumping the windows laptop and using the mac full time with a windows VM.
