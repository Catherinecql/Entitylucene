Virtual Box on an non-intel Mac <body> is it possible to install VirtualBox on a non-intel Mac ?  My configuration : G5 with Mac OS X 10.5.8  <answer8229> No you can't unfortunately.  See the first line of the prerequisites on the virtualbox support pages here  <answer8230> No as VirtualBox does not emulate the CPU but virtualizies it as described by Oracle.   You would need to find Virtual PC or Bochs (I have used both in the past) or others in a list from www.macwindows.com  However now getting an extra second hand intel box might well be the easiest thing to do and would definitely provide the faster solution.
