Batch adding names to mac os spelling dictionary <body> I work at a school, and I would like to add a number of unique names to the local dictionary so that they won't be flagged as misspelled by the spell checker.   I've discovered the local dictionary at ~/Library/Spelling/  I also see that words are added to the localdictionary text file each on individual lines.   However, when I try to paste in a large number of names (or to simply replace this file with another) I find that the new entries aren't recognized by the spell checker, even after killing the applespell process, or restarting altogether.   Ideally, I'd like to set this up so I could create a script to install this custom dictionary on all computers at the school (this works in MS Office). Is this possible?   <answer14952> There is some additional work you need to do because there is actually a special character in between each word. You can see an example of it here on Macworld.  What they suggest is to show invisibles in your text editor of choice, textwrangler or textmate or xcode or vim or something like that would probably work, and just make sure that each word has the same separator as the previous words.  strongFrom Macworld:/strong     To review the user additions to the   spell checking dictionary download a   copy of Bare Bones Software’s free   TextWrangler. Open the en file in   TextWrangler and choose Edit  Text   Options. In the resulting sheet,   enable the Show Invisibles option and   click OK. You’ll find that the   additions are now separated by a red ¿   character.      To edit user additions, delete any   additions you don’t care for or add   new ones, separating them with this   upside-down question mark character   that you’ve copied from within the   document. Save the file and log out   and log back in again for the changes   to take.   <answer38107> The entries in that file must be ordered lexicographically (case-insensitive).  I assume Apple implements some sort of search algorithm, so if codefzgwhduef/code is after codexdejfu/code, it won't be found when spellchecking it.  Edit code~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary/code, keep the entries sorted, and codekillall AppleSpell/code in Terminal to make it read the changed file the next time you use it.  <comment16089> What program are you using to write docs <comment16109> Hmm, when I try this, I don't see the hidden upside down question mark (¿). Instead, the only invisible character I see is the carriage return symbol, which looks a bit like horizontal line with a downward stroke on the right end. <comment78408> `rev /usr/share/dict/words | gshuf  ~/Library/Spelling/en; killall AppleSpell` works just fine for me. For some reason, words that are listed twice but with different capitalization aren't recognized though.
