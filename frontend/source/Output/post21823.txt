Can I install OSX Safari 5.1 for one user and Safari 5.05 for another user - same CPU? <body> I'm running OSX 10.6.8 with Safari 5.01 with my main user account, which is an admin account.br I would like to do some testing with Safari 5.1 before I fully commit to it.  Can I install Safari 5.1 in another user account (non-admin) and keep the Safari 5.05 functional in my admin account?br Can I just install it in the ~/Applications directory of the non-admin user?  <answer21824> No, I don't think so. Reason is that Safari updates replace the whole webkit framework which is a part of OS X, so you can only have one version at a time.   <answer21828> While they don't have version 5, you could install Safari 5.1 as your main browser and then use Multi-Safari to access an earlier version. I hope this helps a little bit.  <answer21829> Why don't you install a Webkit beta? It will be similar to 5.1 (or probably 5.2!) and you can install it alongside your older version of Safari.  You can get it here:  http://nightly.webkit.org/  In case you haven't encountered them before these betas are the truly cutting edge versions of Safari as it is developed.  TBH I have been using 5.1 since the Dev betas (months ago!) and have found them very stable and fast - better than 5.0 IMO.  <answer24918> The person behind Multi-Safari has documented the procedure to create a Safari application with a self-contained WebKit framework here.  Basically it involves duplicating the Safari application, opening the contents and creating a Frameworks folder inside, copying the Framework from code/System/Library/Frameworks/code and then performing some jiggery-pokery to get the application to prefer to use the self-contained framework over the one in the Library folder.  (I decided not to copy his instructions word for word, as his website didn't use Creative Commons.)  <comment28018> As you see - there are several ways to go about this. I'm curious _why_ you are looking to stick with Safari rather than use the nightly webkit development build for testing. It's much less hassle than maintaining two versions of safari. <comment28019> Well done - I was looking for someone who documented this. Thanks so much for this link. <comment28020> Apple certainly doesn't make it easy to do this, but it's doable on several levels with some advanced tinkering and learning a bit _how_ safari actually works. For many, the right answer is "NO" - but for testing it is workable without needing to maintain a whole OS with older browsers.
