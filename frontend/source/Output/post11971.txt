PDF annotation tools for the iPad <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   iPad PDF Reader with annotation support?       I'm considering purchasing a PDF annotation app for the iPad; mostly something that allows me to highlight, add handwritten and typed notes, comments, etc.  I have three closely-related questions:  ol liDoes anybody know of a strongrecent review/strong of PDF annotation tools for the iPad / iPad 2?/li liAlternatively, does anybody have/know of a list of strongpros-and-cons/strong of the different PDF annotation tools for the iPad? /li liDoes strongAdobe/strong have any official application for the iPad? If not, is there are a reason why they don't?/li /ol  Thanks!  <answer11975> ol liA recent review written on March 15th, 2011 placed the top 3 PDF annotation apps. /li /ol     http://www.brandsonly.nl/ipad/2011/03/15/the-3-best-ipad-pdf-markup-apps/   ol liThe pros and cons of the apps are included in the response to 1./li liAdobe has a few official applications for the iPad including one that I use very often which is Adobe Ideas./li /ol  IMO, I bought the iPad app, UPAD. It serves various purposes as a notebook but also includes the functionality of doing what you would like to do with PDF's. A very functional app indeed, but if what you search for is pure PDF annotating, then the provided link with the top PDF annotating apps is your best choice.  <answer31474> I have just been using iAnnotate PDF it's very good for marking PDF's on the go. It's £6.99 in the UK app store. Not sure about the USA price.  <comment18394> the link is dead!
