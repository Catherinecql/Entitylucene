Canon Selphy CP780 Printer for MacBook Air <body> Where can I find information on set up?  <answer8622> Apple's Mac 101 guides for installing a printer: Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard, or earlier versions.  Canon's extra drivers (you probably don't need them, but install if you have a problem).  Hope this helps. If you have a specific problem, please post with more details.  <answer122035> Perhaps you should try the GutenPrint print drivers. These open source drivers work for a huge number of printers, the Selphy CP770 and 790 are listed as supported so either of those might work.  The drivers work with all versions of OS X.  <comment35941> Be aware that up to now there is no OS X 10.7 driver for the Selphy printers and some people have gotten support answers from Canon suggesting that there will be none.
