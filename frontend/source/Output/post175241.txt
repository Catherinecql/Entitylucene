How can I list the IP addresses of all the AirPrint printers on a network? <body> I am trying to make a list of all AirPrint printers on the network at a school. We have many of them because of all the classroom and office printers, but they have not been set up with meaningful names. I tried reading the DHCP allocation table in the router, but many of the printers do not report a host name. I can't check printers in-person because of the disruption to classes from going in to every room and playing with the 1-3 printers there.   The codedns-sd/code command as in How to find IP address of my other Mac? gives a column called emInstance Name/em, rather than the host name. Using the codedns-sd -G/code option on the instance names gave no such record.   codedns-sd -Z/code is closer, since it gives host names to look up with the codeG/code option, but it doesn't give a complete list. There are many more printers in the emAdd Printer/em dialog on a Mac than there are in the output of codedns-sd -Z/code.   Does anyone have some code or script to just find all the IP addresses of things advertising by Bonjour?  <answer239039> subI do not have an AirPrint printer on my network.

Unfortunately any large deployment is going to cause some initial unavoidable pain but this can be mitigated somewhat if the manufacturer has admin/config tools available. <comment206988> Nearly all HP here.
