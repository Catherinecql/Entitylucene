Hide certain files/folders from "All My Files" <body> How can I hide certain files or folders from "All my files" I'm developing a website with 100s of icons and now they making this section in finder quite redundant.  <answer30947> See this this morning on Mac OS X Hints.com:  10.7: Customize All My Files   I agree that in the case of pros, this All my files thing is quite useless because there is way too many files. This is more a consumer-level thing.
