SpeechRecognitionServer not found in Mavericks with applescript? <body> I am trying to use an applescript to get speech input from a user and then perform and action. However, the code i'm using was made for osx lion. When I put it into applescript editor, the editor gives me a pop-up asking where "speechrecognitionserver" is. How do i find it? I'm on OSX mavericks right now.  the code is here: http://media.pragprog.com/titles/mrhome/code/GivingYourHomeAVoice/osx-voice-automation.scpt  <answer127399> Right at        precode/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/SpeechRecognition.framework/Versions/A/SpeechRecognitionServer.app /code/pre  When it asks, click Browse and type kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdshift ⇧/kbd+kbdG/kbd, then paste the path in.  With that specific script there are a few errors (you'll need to get rid of the codeÂ/codes with find and replace, and there is a comment after a line continuation character in codeelse if voiceResponse is "pause music" or Â¬   -- &lt;callout id="code.osx-voice-automation.scpt.miscmusic"/&gt;/code). After doing that I got it to run on my machine.  Oh, and if you're wondering emhow/em I found it - codemdfind/code is Spotlight's Terminal interface, and it shows hidden files, so when I ran codemdfind SpeechRecognitionServer/code it came up with the path.
