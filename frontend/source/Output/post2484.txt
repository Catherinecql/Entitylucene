Is it possible to show multi-level threads in Mail.app? <body> I like the threaded view for mail.app, but it only groups the messages per thread. In other words, there's only two levels: the original messages, and all the replies that came after that.  Is it possible (perhaps via plugin?) to show a multi-level view of the e-mail thread in mail.app?  <answer3184> I'm sorry; that's not possible.  <answer3204> As an alternative to the lack of Mail features (good threading being one of those), you can try any of the following, which I’m sure you already know:  ul liPostbox: Lots of features, multiplatform, not free./li liThunderbird: Very decent mail client, free and also multiplatform. /li liMailplane: If you like Gmail but don’t want to lose OS X features, Mailplane is a very decent alternative combining the best of gmail with a respectable OS X integration. /li liSparrow: A new alternative (only for gmail) that is growing in popularity for its ease of use and iPad-like interface. Although it only works for gmail, the plan is to expand it. Still very beta. Still free. Worth to follow around and check every now and then./li liThere may be others but these are the most known/used (excluding Mail.app of course). Eudora is also popular, but I believe it’s a little bit outdated. /li /ul  <comment2867> good answer ;-)
