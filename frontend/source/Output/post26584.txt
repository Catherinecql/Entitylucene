How can I retroactively import files into my Itunes library? <body> How can I get Itunes to move everything to my library retroactively. When I add new songs, it copies them to my library but I have a lot of music that I added before I discovered I could enable the auto import to library function. How can I get itunes to go back and copy all of those to the  Itunes auto-organized library? My files are spread out all over the place, it would be nice to have them in one place.  <answer26586> If you go to File - Library - Organise Library you'll get a pop up asking if you'd like to Consolidate Library, that'll move all the files into the iTunes music folder.  Apple Support Document on how to do it.
