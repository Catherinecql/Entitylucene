Bootcamp Windows 7 loading time optimization <body> I've created a bootcamp partition and successfully installed Windows 7 there. The problem is that Windows loads too slow - there is a white pointer on black screen blinking for 2 or 3 minutes before system starts loading, so total loading time exeeds to 4 minutes. How can I reduce Windows loading time? I'm using MBP 2010 MC371, so there should be no perfomance problems.  <answer7289> You could try the solution on http://viperfx07.blogspot.com but I haven't had the problem myself so I can't say whether it will solve your issue  emJust to note that this may be due to your copy of Windows not being genuine/em  <comment7820> I don't think the Windows Genuine Advantage kicks in until Windows is loaded, and this sounds like it's in the pre-boot environment. <comment7833> It's not WGA kicking in, it's the bootloader looking for firmware which doesn't exist and it pauses because it can't find it. <comment7996> Finally, I've managed to fix my problem!
