Run iTunes without it being in the dock <body> I'm trying to keep my dock simple - just Chrome, MacVim, and the terminal. Is there a way to run iTunes without it being in the dock (i.e. just show the icon in the menu bar)?  <answer16777> The only way for an application to not appear in the dock (while also keeping the menu bar) is for the developers to place that functionality into it. I don't use my dock as a launcher, using Butler instead (which is a dockless application, btw).  You might try backing up a step and asking why you want to remove the iTunes from the dock and see if there's another solution. For example, I often listen to tunes on my iPhone rather than iTunes. If it's to keep the dock clean, try a different launcher than the dock and hide the dock instead.  <answer16789> From strongHERE/strong. I have not personally tried it with iTunes, but it does work with some applications.   precodeIf you'd like to have an application running, but without a dock icon, there's a  way achieve this by modifying the application's plist file.  Open a terminal session, and first navigate to the "Contents" folder of the  application you'd like to modify (note - you may want to make a backup of the app  first, especially if it's one of the Apple-installed applications). This example  uses Key Caps:  cd 'Applications/Utilities/iTunes.app/Contents/'  Now, edit the Info.plist file:  vi Info.plist  You can use vi, pico, or emacs to do the editing.   Just before the closing Just before the closing &lt;/dict&gt; tag, add  &lt;key&gt;NSBGOnly&lt;/key&gt;  &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;  Save the edited Info.plist, then launch iTunes from the GUI (your application foler). If your edit was successful, you should see iTunes, but no icon in the dock. /code/pre  <answer16798> Two things come close: you can (in Finder) select the iTunes application and 'get info', then paste a new icon  over the icon (at top of the info window).  The trick is, you use a selected patch of your desktop background picture as the icon (open the desktop picture in Preview, select a patch and copy). Or, to put items in the dock that don't take up space until you click them, but are always easy to locate without navigating folders, make a folder and put aliases of applications and such into it. Then, drag the folder to the dock, where a single click on the icon of the folder will show all the contents.  <comment18320> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11592/hide-xscope-dock-icon <comment18331> That's pure apple flexibility :/
