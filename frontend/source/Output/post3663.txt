adjust battery-warning-level of magic mouse <body> How can I adjust the level at which Mac OS warns me about the battery of my magic mouse?br I always have a lack of batteries, so I would prefer if the battery warning comes up at 15 or 20%, so I could work the rest of the day with the almost empty batteries and put them in the charger before I go to sleep.   Right now, if the warning occurs in the morning I have a problem.br I tried to steal the batteries out of my girlfriends camera or her wireless keyboard, but she does karate and defends her batteries.br Buying another set is not an option.  A way to get the battery level via applescript, shellscript, automator, whatever would be applicable too.  <answer3888> This thread has some scripts that can help you.  It seems that you wrap the results of this shell snippet in a nice AppleScript:  precodeioreg -c BNBMouseDevice | grep BatteryPercent /code/pre  <answer296035> In my strongmacOS Sierra 10.12.6/strong, there is no codeBNBMouseDevice/code. Script which works for me is:  precodeioreg -c AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService -r -l | grep BatteryPercent | sed 's/[^[:digit:]]//g' /code/pre  Source: Check the battery level of connected bluetooth headphones from the command line  <comment311416> The link no longer works. Do you have something more up to date?
