How to get Finder in Lion to set group permissions to read/write by default? <body> To have group permissions set to read/write by default in Snow Leopard and Leopard, I used code/etc/launchd-user.conf/code to set the umask to 002.  This still works in Lion in every app emexcept/em the Finder. Actually, Lion's Finder does apply the umask when setting permissions, but if the group (or everyone) bit is set to zero, the Finder will treat it like it's a 2, which makes new folders' group permissions read only.  Out of curiosity, I did try using the old technique I used in OS X 10.4, using the codedefaults/code command to set the umask and NSUmask, but that doesn't work (which was expected).  I'm hoping to find a solution without having to use ACLs.  Does anyone know of another way to get the Finder in Lion to set group permissions to read/write by default?  <answer30589> You can use BatChmod for setting permissions of files. You can also use it to chmod a batch of files. Download link: http://download.cnet.com/BatChmod/3000-2248_4-19574.html  <comment26733> Are you making folders with Finder? Or copying files? <comment26734> @bmike This is only for new folders (and new alias files). Copying files & folders will retain group read/write permissions from the original.
