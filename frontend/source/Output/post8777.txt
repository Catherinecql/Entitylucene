Looking for a free/cheap backup solution on OSX for NTFS external HDD <body> I'm looking for an incremental backup system on OS X that plays nice with USB NTFS-formatted external HDDs. I am currently using NTFS-3G to work with the HDD, but since Time Machine doesn't work with NTFS drives, I have just been manually copying files from my HDD to back it up (ugh).    I need to use an NTFS drive because I am going back and forth between Windows machines at my school and a Mac at home. I have no permissions at my school to install any Windows software, so I am forced to find an OS X solution.  <answer8778> I have no experience using the Mac client at all.  So I can't say for sure whether it specifically works with an NTFS formatted drive.  But CrashPlan has a client that can theoretically do what you want for free.  <answer8780> You can use Time Machine. This page tells how to enable NTFS for writing from Snow Leopard.  <answer8847> CrashPlan is great for Mac backup. But it dose NOT officially support NTFS Drives. There is a workaround. and I have made it work.  See here:  http://support.crashplan.com/doku.php/recipe/back_up_windows_mapped_drives
