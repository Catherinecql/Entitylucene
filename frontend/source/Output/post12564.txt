Tcl/tk for Mac OS X 10.6, not possible to download? <body> I've upgraded git today and in its README file I found the following excerpt:     If you don't already have Tcl/Tk Aqua   installed on your computer (most MacOS   X installs have it), you will get this   error message. To resolve it, simply   go to the website for Tcl / Tk Aqua   and download the latest version:      http://www.categorifiedcoder.info/tcltk/      If you have an older version of Tcl /   Tk Aqua, you'll benefit from   upgrading. There have been many   usability improvements since the   version that comes shipped with MacOS   X Leopard.   I tried the link and it redirects to Daniel A. Steffen LinkedIn page, who is the lead developer of Tcl/Tk for Mac, as far as I understand. I tried googling to find alternative links, but they all redirect to the same LinkedIn page. From this I gather that either this alternative version is already included in the Mac OS X, or there is some ongoing conflict. Can anybody enlighten the situation?  <answer12566> Tcl/Tk Aqua is available from this page  http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcltkaqua/  This page has the latest version.  <answer60553> As an alternative, Tcl (beta) is now available as from ActiveState  <comment13213> Pretty bizare, git documentation suggests that installing this version is advantageous, but this version is dated 2005.
