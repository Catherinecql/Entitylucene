Google Maps app crashes on open for iPad <body> I'm traveling now and relying heavily on Google Maps on my iPad. with no warning, the app now crashes instantly when I click on it. no warning at all. I tap the icon, the default screen comes up, a second later the app closes.  Has anyone else experienced this problem? More imporrtantly, has anyone found a solution?  I tried restarting my iPad, as well as a hard reset. I do not have my laptop so I cannot sync. Since the app is one of the few default apps, I cannot delete and re-download it. I'm really at a loss here, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  <answer25251> I was about to say "Have you tried turning it on and off again" ;)  As an alternative to what you're experiencing whilst in your situation have you tried just using Safari and browsing to http://maps.google.com? Failing that you could download the National Geographic Map app. This uses some older-style-maps and if you zoom in far enough it revents to Bing Maps. I don't know why they didn't go for Google maps, probably a licensing thing as their app is a tidy $3.99.  The only real answer I can give you is update your iPad. Just think in a few months, with you'll be able to run updates without the need for a computer or iTunes.  <answer82238> Deleting a downloaded app does two things:  ol liJettisons the data (like a reset for that app)/li liAllows for a clean copy of the app to be downloaded again/li /ol  You could restore the entire device and test maps before restring your backup or you could back it up and erase all content and settings and then test.  Flip a coin if one of those two options does not seem better to you and feel free to ask a follow on question if you find some more details to add to the question and don't want to edit them into the existing question.
