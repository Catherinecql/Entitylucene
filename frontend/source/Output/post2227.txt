iPhone 3GS, ATT MicroCell, iOS 4.0.1, failure to connect <body> I was a very happy customer of my microcell until the upgrade to 4.0 and the subsequent patch. Now, at best, I can force an M-cell connection by flipping to airplane and back. I have completely reinitialized the M-cell. Is there way way around this except to whine to AT&amp;T and wait for someone to fix something?  <answer2228> Try resetting your network settings. Many iPhone connectivity issues can be resolved with that.  <answer2229> I have had 3 MicroCells from ATT. The first lasted 29 days and then could not be re-synced, the second lasted 6 days and could not be re-synced. The third could not be re-synced from the outset. I finally took it back for credit. The serial numbers for all three were close enough together to be from the same manufacturing batch. I believe there is a component failre -- of the infant mortality variety -- in the cell circuit. In all three the GPS sync was not a problem.  <answer32345> Most recent advice from AT&amp;T for iPhone 4 (assuming 3G, 3Gs, and 4Gs) and MicroCell connectivity.    ol liUnplug MicroCell for 30 seconds.  /li liPlug it back in./li liTurn off iPhone for 30 seconds./li liTurn it back on./li liReset Network Settings on iPhone.  (Under Settings - General - Reset Network Setting)  This will cycle the iPhone (turn it on and off automatically)  WARNING:  Resetting this will require you to rejoin your network (if wireless) and to re-enter your password for the network.  Make sure you have it before you do this!!!/li liWait until Friday when AT&amp;T will call me back and explain why the iPhone won't force connect to the MicroCell when I get back to my house.  Or when a random 1 bar of edge network signal is picked up and permanently disconnects it./li /ol  At the end of the day, the only success I've had is putting your phone into Airplane mode for a second and then turning Airplane mode off.  Take it or leave it, this is the best I've got right now.  <comment1878> I've been hearing about this Microcell lately. What made you get one? Do you live in a bad service area? Or does it boost network performance in ANY area? <comment1879> They sell it for $150 at AT&T stores in the US, and rumor has it that they are giving them away to certain 'good' customers.  They give you a short-range cell in your house that backhauls via the internet. You plug it into an ethernet, and it sits there providing 5 bars within 40 feet. <comment1880> Very cool! I think I might look into it. Thanks! <comment1881> This has nothing to do with Wifi or edge, I think. The m-cell is just a cell; it's like having your own private cell tower. <comment1882> It sounds like it's directly related to me. Network Settings controls all of the device's communications (maybe with the exception of bluetooth). I think resetting will fix the issue. (The title of link I sent excludes 3G, but that's included in the fix as well)
