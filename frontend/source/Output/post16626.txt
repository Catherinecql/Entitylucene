Any way to view Microsoft Publisher files in Mac OS X <body> I'm trying to view a MS Publisher file without running a Windows virtual machine. Any way to do that? It's ok if it doesn't render 100% accurately.  <answer21332> Another vote for Crossover/Wine. Not sure how well Publisher runs personally, but I know that the rest of Office 2003 (if that's the version that you're using) works perfectly (and that's using the free version they gave out a couple of years ago, I imagine it's only gotten better since).  <answer24652> If your idea is only to strongREAD/strong and never to edit, I would suggest that you convert the file into PDF format using any of the thousands free converters out there, for example:     http://www.publishertopdf.com/   So you don't need a license of Microsoft Publisher neither CrossOver.  <answer94728> Another vote for converting first. If you convert the file using Zamzar online, then you can open the file as a PDF on your Mac. You could also ask the sender to save in an alternative format if that's an option for you.

They have a free trial and you can check other versions for compatibility here... http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=457 <comment27737> Nice service! Thanks for the tip. <comment111048> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
