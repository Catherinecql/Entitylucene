Can I get my iPhone to AirPrint to my HP Officejet 6500 E709n <body> I have an HP Officejet 6500 E709n.  It is not the exact model that is listed as "AirPrint" compatible.  Is there a way to get it to work any way?  I would love to be able to print from my iPhone.  <answer31242> Its not quite AirPrint, but have you tried the official HP ePrint Home &amp; Biz application?  I have it installed on my iPhone and it picks up and prints to HP Photosmart C4500 really easily. Also, installing this application adds a "open with" option when you are viewing a compatible document (pdf/doc/etc) in the web browser / email application etc. That means you just click "open with" then select Hp ePrint and it opens the document straight into the app ready for printing. you even get a print preview as you would printing from your desktop.
