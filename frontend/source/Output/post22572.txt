How to get back the "Login Window..." icon in the menu bar? <body> Once I've upgraded to Lion I had a new icon on my Menu Bar next to Spotlight. It was an outline of a mugshot similar like one of the Guest account.  When I clicked on that icon I was able to select "Login Window..." which basically locked my Mac.  For some reason this icon is gone. I don't use it frequently so I can't clearly say when it went missing but I'd say within last 10 days probably.  How do I get it back? I have no idea where to re-enable it.  <answer22573> It can be enabled via strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong  [Unlock]  strongLogin Options/strong  strongShow fast user switching menu as.../strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SKkTI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment25120> The personal silhouette icon is the Fast User Switching menu. I have an entry called "Login Screen" below the user choices. Is that what you are missing? <comment25121> Thanks @Nate Bird. Only just found it and answered it myself.
