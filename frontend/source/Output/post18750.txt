Flash on OS X Lion <body> Flash is not supported in OS X Lion i.e. Safari, how can I browse webpages with flash content and actually view the flash content?  <answer18752> Were did you heard that Flash is not supported in Lion?  Flash is very well supported, I have it running in Safari and Chrome and it works fine.  <answer18756> Adobe Flash Player is supported in Lion (Chrome works by using its own copy of the plug-in that you can disable) and Safari uses the Plug-in installed in your personal libraries folder:  precode~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ /code/pre  or in the system-wide libraries:  precode/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ /code/pre  Lion, however, doesn't ship with Flash player installed by default (I'm not 100% sure because I haven't had Flash in a long time), but that doesn't stop you from installing it.  Head over to Adobe's FlashPlayer download page and select 10.4-10.6 as your operating system:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5uMt2.jpg" alt="Flash Player Download"   So as you can see there is not a 10.7 version yet, so there are some issues. At first it was said that Lion disabled the Hardware acceleration of Flash; Adobe later retracted that when they found out it was their own bug.     The final release of Mac OS X Lion (10.7) provides the same support   for Flash hardware video acceleration as Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6).   The previous “Known Issue” described in a tech note suggesting that   video hardware acceleration was disabled in Lion was incorrect and   based on tests with a pre-release version of Mac OS X Lion that   related to only one particular Mac GPU configuration.   subsource: Adobe's Blog/sub  If you are brave enough, you could try the BETA version (used by developers) that is theoretically the version that will be released for Lion.  Those Betas are available Here.  <comment20513> Well... "Fine". It's flash we're talking about; so I'd say it works like in Snow Leopard. <comment20514> Adobe has released a document with known issues of their products when running OS X Lion & flash is one of them. You can scan every file in your system, there is no flash & you can't download it since Adobe only support up to Snow Leopard.http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/905/cpsid_90508.html <comment20522> Downloaded the Flash Plugin from Adobe's Download Page & it worked fine thanks. FYI The plugin installed is the 10.7 beta version by default x x x <comment20535> Glad it worked Samantha! Remember that the beta is a little bit rough yet according to Adobe :)
