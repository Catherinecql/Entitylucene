iOS5 - Does the ActiveSync Pin code lock prevent the new camera shortcut? <body> I've had an iPhone of various vintages for 3 years connected to MS Exchange activesync for work email.  Part of the deal with this that you need to enter a four digit PIN before you unlock.   I was quite excited about the iOS5 camera option available from the lock screen.   From what I can see - the camera shortcut is not available if you have ActiveSync enabled and thus the four digit PIN. I'm asking the question because I hope I am wrong. Here is my question:  Does the ActiveSync Pin code lock prevent the new camera shortcut?  <answer27473> No, the PIN Code doesn't prevent you from using the camera shortcut.  Just make sure to strongdouble-press/strong the home button to show the camera shortcut.  Note: you can't access your old photos as long as the iPhone is locked.
