HFS on Snow Leopard read only <body> Snow Leopard seems to have dropped support for the HFS (not HFS+) filesystem in Disk Utility. I have an HFS disk image that I created on a Leopard system. In Snow Leopard, this disk image is read only. I also can't create a new HFS disk image in Disk Utility, the option is missing.   Is there a way to mount or create an HFS disk image as read/write in Snow Leopard? (Perhaps a codediskutil/code command?)  <answer8599> This ability has been removed from Snow Leopard.  It is possible with a 3rd party tool.  What you need is FuseHFS.  <comment9190> FUSE is a wonderful thing. Thanks!
