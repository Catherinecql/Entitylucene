iChat can't authenticate to Lion Server 10.7.2 <body> I've enabled iChat and iCal Server through our local 10.7.2 Server which has DNS set up correctly. I can add the server account via a client's System Preferences (under other - Mac OS X server) and it authenticates with my shortname correctly.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMcp0.jpg" alt="System Preferences add Server Account Dialoge"  However, when I load iChat, I get this error message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGsAH.jpg" alt="iChat error message"  Where the account is myusername@servername.ourdomain.co.nz. The password and username is correct.   Console throws this error:     22/11/11 3:03:31.135 PM imagent: [Warning] XMPPConnection: Error: Error Domain=XMPPErrorDomain Code=105 "The operation couldn�t be completed. (XMPPErrorDomain error 105.)" UserInfo=0x7f81bbe2a3e0 {XMPPErrorText=service requested for unknown domain}   DNS is set up correctly (it's working for Profile Management, Software Update Server and Web Services) but I can't get iChat to work correctly.   strongHow can I get clients to authenticate?/strong  FYI: It's probably worth noting that I get the exact same error messages when I use username@domain.co.nz instead of username@servername.domain.co.nz.  Also posted this question on Apple Discussion here.  <answer32164> This question was answered on Apple Discussions. In short, the server was misconfigured to have the Jabber Domain set to the local DNS name - rather than a FQDN.   The problem was fixed by issuing the following terminal command:     sudo serveradmin settings jabber jabber:hosts:_array_index:0 = "servername.domain.co.nz"   You can check this discussion for full details. Thankyou sfatula on Apple Discussions for the solution!
