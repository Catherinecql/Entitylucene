Do MacBook Pros have support for the Remote Control? <body> Do the new (2011) MacBook Pros work with Apple's Remote Control?  I'm little confused because the Apple Store offers me an Apple Remote when I try buying a new MacBook Pro, but I don't see any information about support for that remote in the MacBook Pro's description.  <answer9522> Yes it does support it. You can verify this information because when you go to the apple store and select a new model, one of the accesories you can add to your purchase is the apple remote. They wouldn't add that if you couldn't use it :)  I assume the IrDA port is there @ the front of the machine, possible hard to see in the official pictures.   <answer9571> Yes it does. If you have the dock which supports it try not to put them close as it's the closest IR connection to you that picks it up!  <answer9572> From the Manual for the 13inch, here is a picture that shows you where the IR port is located.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5H7L4.png" alt="Basic Features of MacBook Pro"  <comment10035> This is a proof, which I want! thx
