Apps cannot be installed anymore because of missing signature <body> I was working on my iPhone 4 with iOS 4.2 (the last one) for a while, when I called my phone operator to unlock the simlock. I followed the procedure, and I saved of my iPhone with iTunes, then restored it, then restored the backup with iTunes (last version). I didn't do anything special but followed the path given by iTunes on a reset / restore procedure.  After the restore procedure, some apps that I have been using for months did not get installed. According to iTunes the two reasons are:  ul liMissing signature, /li lior Resources modified. /li /ul  This also happens with newly downloaded applications after the reset.  My iPhone is not (and wasn't) jailbroken, and I don't understand what happened.  How may I solve this problem, without loosing datas, apps, music or photo libraries, or need to reinstall everything from scratch app per app ?  Some additional notes:  ul liAny app that I download now that doesn't want to install from iTunes, can be correctly installed when downloaded directly on the iPhone. And no sync problems with iTunes./li liEven updating a working and installed app can cause the problem./li liNew error with an app download from iTunes : "Unknown error 0xE800000B"/li liNo music (nor anything else) is displayed in the iPod app, but iTunes shows the music, podcatsts, ... as present on the iPhone./li /ul  With BitDefender fully deactivated (as it cannot be quit), and ZoneAlarm shut down, it does not change anything. Not a surprise as they where both activated days ago and everything was working fine before the restore procedure.  <answer9672> Problem solved : was a conflict with "ZoneAlarm Free" Don't know why it hasn't been resolved the first times I had deactivated it. But now, when I shut it down, no more problem with the sync except some rare apps that may really be corrupted I guess.  <comment9869> Have you ever used other means to install apps other than your own iPhone and your own iTunes? <comment9876> @Cawas : I never did
