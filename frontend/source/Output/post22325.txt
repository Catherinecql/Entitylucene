Can't see logical Windows NTFS partition in OS X <body> I have already asked this question over here   https://superuser.com/questions/323414/cant-see-logical-windows-ntfs-partition-in-os-x  and I got one answer thats satisfying but risky to attempt such action, so anyone else can up with less risky alternative?  <answer22472> Mac OS X does not natively support RW access to NTFS partitions.   You'll need a combination of MacFUSE:  http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/  and Amit Singh's NTFS RW driver:  http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/  <answer29164> MacFuse is pretty much abandonware, and hasn't been updated since 2009. There is a new project called OSXFuse that is picking up where MacFuse left off and is compatible with Lion:   http://osxfuse.github.com/  Also, as of 10/25/2011, the easy download location for the open source NTFS-3G  http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/2010/10/ntfs-3g-for-mac-os-x-2010102.html  <answer37629> I vote for installing NTFS-3G via macports and it is the best way IMHO.
