Network Shares disappeared after adding shared volume to boot items <body> I wanted to add a have a network share mount on boot so I added it to the users boot items. The volume mounted successfully but other network shares are no longer visible either through the sidebar or via Finder  Go  Network.   Previously my other mac book pro, which is set up for screen sharing would be in the server list as would my NAS (Lacie Network Space), which would appear as both an afp and smb share. The NAS is now the only option available as afp or smb, it was one of the shared folders on this that I added as a boot item.  Finder  Go  Connect to Server works but I no longer have the option to browse for shares  I have removed the share from the boot items.  So far I have tried:  ul liunchecking all options under Finder  Preferences  Sidebar  Shared, rebooting and then checking again./li liDeleting all the files in Library  Preferences  SystemConfiguration and rebooting/li liReplacing all files in the above from a previous back up/li /ul  Unfortunately I don't back up anywhere near enough so a full restore from back up is a last resort.  All shares are visible from my other macbook pro, running Leopard  The real question is how to I make the network shares visible/browsable again?  <answer17046> Well this turns out not to be a Mac issue after all!  Restarting my router fixes the problem. It seems to have DNS issues every now and then.
