Will my Canon CanoScan 500F scanner work with Lion? <body> I'm getting a lot of TWAINBridge errors in the console and Image Capture won't scan documents like it did last week (on 10.6.8 Snow Leopard).  precode7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- p 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- s 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- n 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- _ 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- 0 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- _ 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- 5 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- 4 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- 0 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- 8 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- 0 7/23/11 1:46:18.822 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/TWAINBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/TWAINBridge: illegal option -- 4 7/23/11 2:20:05.051 PM [0x0-0x84084].com.apple.TWAINBridge: ImageIO: &lt;ERROR&gt;  JPEG Application transferred too few scanlines /code/pre  I checked the canon site - and the latest drivers are only for 10.6 - no mention is made of this scanner on the Canon list of devices that work with Lion.  I have rebooted twice, checked the cables. I'm hoping someone can point out something I may have missed that might get things going for me.  If not, it's off to the used market with some Core Duo macs and all my rosetta software!  <answer18431> It looks like some old saved settings were causing the scanner to hang indefinitely  - pressing scan over and over wasn't working.  I pressed the show details button a few times but didn't realize things were working slowly in the background. After a minute or so - I was able to get into the details, change some settings, and it has been working well.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XYPHA.jpg" alt="enter image description here" Those TWAIN errors are not logging now either. Life is good again in Lion scan land.
