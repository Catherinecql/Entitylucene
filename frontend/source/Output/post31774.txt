Is it possible to create formatted email on the iphone 4s? <body> I'd like my email from my phone to look like the email from my MS Outlook. The email from my phone looks like ASCII, and there is no way to create a signature with a logo as far as I know. Any suggestions?  <answer31776> iOS 5 brought some limited rich-text formatting options to Mail. When you're composing an email, select the text you want to format, and tap the right arrow. You'll see a button labelled "BIU", tap that and you get options to bold, italicize or underline the text. You can also control the indentation level.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZd80.jpg" alt="iOS Mail Formatting" (Image from Macworld)  As you can see, it's fairly limited, and to my knowledge there's no way to insert a signature with any images. You could keep the logo you want in your iPhone's Pictures and copy/paste it as necessary, but that's obviously very labour intensive.  Your could look into alternative mail apps. There aren't a lot to choose from, but something like MarkdownMail might work well for you. It's just meant for composing HTML formatted emails, you'd still use the built-in Mail app for checking, etc.   <comment38214> Thanks I found this useful for adding Bold to a signature on mail
