Increasing video memory on an older macbook <body> I have a 2,1 macbook with 4GB ram of which 64mb are dedicated to the video card. Can I increase this to at least 512?  <answer6094> Generally, VRAM is soldered on/in somewhere.  I suppose you emcould/em, if you had the know how, but the short answer is, no.  Edit:  That is, VRAM is not (usually) taken from the pool of "available RAM," it's actually separate RAM entirely.  And dedicated to the GPU, only.  <comment6335> well that royally sucks <comment6337> Actually, MacBooks tend to have integrated graphics, which do not have separate VRAM - they do use the same RAM as everything else. Unfortunately, I don't believe there is a way to increase the RAM allotment.
