How does one a base a podcast playlist off of release date? <body> I'd like to be able to make a playlist that is all recently released podcasts.  Unfortunately release date is not a field available for selection in a smart playlist in iTunes.  Similar-ish dates like date added and modified date won't be close to release date when downloading the back-catalogue of newly added podcast.  The best solution I've come up with is to close itunes, truncate the iTunes Library.itl file, copy the release date field values in the iTunes Music Library.xml file into the date added field, and then relaunch iTunes, and letting it rebuild the itl file from the xml file.   However, my library file is large enough that the rebuild takes 20-30 min, and even with no hacking of the xml, fails more often than not.  Is there a method for me to either or both of:   ul lihack the itl file to set the date added to the release date?/li libe able to select the release date either in rules for a smart playlist or the "limit to... selected by" dropdown of a smart playlist?/li /ul  <answer29875> I probably have a workaround. Create a new smart playlist based on Media Kind is Podcast. Add additional criteria if needed. Sort this playlist by column Release Date.  If you need to listen to it on iPod by Release Date also then Choose Copy to Play Order from the context menu of the playlist. Sync the playlist with iPod. And start playing them from this playlist.  Please report if this work since I'm not able to find my cable right now to check if this really work.  P.S. Playlist will include not only recently released podcasts of course but you can limit it size either by track, size or time additionally to other filters.  <answer29940> I'm not much of an AppleScripter, so this is modified from some scripts at Doug's AppleScripts website, but it's GPLed, so derivative works are allowed as long as they're also GPLed.  My idea was to make a script that could take the release date, which can't be used in smart playlists, and store it in the last skipped date, which can be used in smart playlists. If you just want to do this for podcasts (not for songs, for which you might actually stronguse/strong the last skipped field), just select your podcasts before running this script.  Once you do that, you can create a smart playlist selected on the "Last skipped" field to get the recently released podcasts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ra1PA.png" alt="enter image description here"  So here we go:  precode (*  You can rename this script to whatever you want  but please keep this information intact.

Yay!  <comment34358> This is actually what I'm doing right now - my problem is that when limiting the size of the playlist, you must select a "selected by" criteria, and the criteria I want is "most recently released" <comment34400> This has lead me to a working result, though since I'm using window it didn't actually work for me. <comment34406> 'Doh. Sorry about assuming you were on Mac. <comment34415> no worries, you lead me down the right path so I figured that's good reason to award the bounty :)
