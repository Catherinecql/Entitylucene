amplify sound output on mac <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Do you know a simple sound booster app for Mac?       Is there an app to amplify sound output on mac osx, I've put the volume to max and its still quiet.  <answer8322> VLC can boost the volume for stuff played through it by 400%.  Your internal speakers might not like being pushed that hard though.  You could also try the preamp on the iTunes equalizer.  To use the equalizer, in iTunes, click Window  Equalizer and slide the preamp slider upwards.  Also, for a system-wide solution there's Audio Hijack but you need to pay for the full product.  <answer8346> Boom is a simple program that does nothing except boost the system volume past its maximum. It can also increase the volume of audio files, although iTunes can also do this. It does cost money, but only $5.  <comment8956> I'm watching a flash video through chrome, so I need a general solution <comment8957> Audio Hijack which I linked to is a general solution, it's just not a free solution <comment18823> Awesome. Boom works great. $5 bucks is a bit steep but they have a 1 week free trial.
