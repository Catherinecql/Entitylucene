Does Chase's QuickDeposit feature work on the iPod Touch 4G? <body> Now that the new iPod Touch has a camera, I'm thinking of buying it.br However, since Apple crippled its resolution (960 x 720), I'm not so sure.  Does Chase Mobile's QuickDeposit feature work with the lower camera resolution?  <answer6055> looks like they just updated to version 2.8.1202, release notes say "Quick Deposit for iPod touch - Now you can use your camera-enabled iPod touch to make a deposit."
