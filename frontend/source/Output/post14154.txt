Change Snow Leopard Terminal window dependant on SSH Server <body> I can find it hard to differentiate between my dev and production server. I am using SSH to connect to the machines (both Ubuntu 10.04), and I was wondering whether there is a way to change the colour of the Terminal window depending on what SSH server it is connected to as I will forget to change the colour for each server...  <answer14159> In Terminal.app you can change the "theme" per tab (e.g. Pro or Ocean) by right-click on a single tab -- Inspect Tab-- Settings. Also you can use iTerm for it has this option: "Tab labels can change color to indicate the session activities"  <answer14162> This blog post provides a script to solve this problem.  precode#!/bin/bash # # ssh into a machine and automatically set the background # color of Mac OS X Terminal depending on the hostname. # # Installation: # 1. Save this script to /some/bin/ssh-host-color # 2. chmod 755 /some/bin/ssh-host-color # 3. alias ssh=/some/bin/ssh-host-color # 4. Configure your host colors below.  set_term_bgcolor() {    local R=$1    local G=$2    local B=$3    /usr/bin/osascript &lt;&lt;EOF tell application "Terminal"    tell window 0       set the background color to {$(($R*65535/255)), $(($G*65535/255)), $(($B*65535/255))}    end tell end tell EOF }  # Host-specific background colors. if [[ "$@" =~ production1.com ]]; then    set_term_bgcolor 127 0 0 elif [[ "$@" =~ production2.com ]]; then    set_term_bgcolor 0 127 0 fi  ssh $@  # Default background color. set_term_bgcolor 34 79 188 /code/pre  <answer14182> I tried using different colors for different SSH sessions a while back. It didn’t really work out because I would forgot which machine was the red one and which was the blue too easily.  I ended up learning myself a few commands that tell you where you are, and who you are there. emwhoami/em for example.  <answer14186> Using iTerm2, you can change the title bar and tab color for each server from the .bashrc on each machine.  See the docs for information on this.  I combine this with setting the prompt color to make it easy to tell apart.  I generally have one iTerm window per server, possible with multiple tabs.  This makes it easy to find the right window in Expose.  Here is the relevant section of my .cshrc.  It would need to be adapted for bash (NOTE: ^] is control+] and ^G is control+G)  precodeif ( ${?term} != 0 ) then     # tab window     alias cwdcmd 'printf "^]1;%s^G^]2;%s^G" "$cwd:t" "$HOST `echo $cwd | sed s $HOME-~-`" '     # Set title/tab color     alias settermr "echo -n '^]6;1;bg;red;brightness;\!*^G'"     alias settermg "echo -n '^]6;1;bg;green;brightness;\!*^G'"     alias settermb "echo -n '^]6;1;bg;blue;brightness;\!*^G'"     settermr 171;settermg 0;settermb 0     # Set title text     alias settitle 'echo -n "^]2; "\!*"^G"'     settitle `hostname -s`     # Set tab text     alias settab 'echo -n "^]1; "\!*"^G"'     settab $cwd:h:t/$cwd:t     cwdcmd /code/pre  endif
