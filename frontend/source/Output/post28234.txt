Create multiple bookmarks on iPad/iPhone home screen at once <body> I have a list of about 10 bookmarks I want to create as iOS home screen icons. Are there quick ways to do this?  And is there a way to edit them once they're created?  <answer28235> I would strongnope/strong and strongnope/strong, at least without jailbreaking.  You can only create bookmark one by one and name them as you want.  Once they are created, the only way to rename them is to create a new one and delete the old one.  Jailbreaking allows to rename any apps, so I think web apps, too. I'm not sure about editing home screen web apps.
