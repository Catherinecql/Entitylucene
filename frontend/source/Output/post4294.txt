How do I boot into the EFI firmware shell? <body> I'd like to experiment with the EFI shell on a MacBook Pro 2010 model.  I am unable to find the keyboard sequence to hold on boot.  Does someone know what the sequence is, do I need to boot from my Snow Leopard CD instead to access this or has the EFI shell been left out (I read that Intel makes it an optional component) ?  Thanks,  Scott  <answer4300> Yup, apparently it is missing and you have to install EDK to get it.
