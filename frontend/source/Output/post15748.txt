iPad 2 cannot connect to a Microsoft Exchange server with Outlook Web Access (OWA) <body> I just bought an iPad 2 and wish to link to the Microsoft Exchange email server Outlook Web Access connection. Sadly even though all details are correct it still says that the details are unable to be verified and obviously can not load emails.  For the record i can successfully connect via OWA connection on browser.  Also I have been able to load calendar. Also the Signature also seems to have been loaded.  <answer24968> You should have the Microsoft Exchange Server administrator to enable emAutodiscover/em in Outlook Web Access for the time it takes you to first authenticate your Mail program on your iPad. Afterwards the administrator can disable Auto-Discovery if it is deemed undesirable.  Apple's documentation for connecting to a Macintosh says the following. I'm assuming the same will apply to configuring the Mail app on an iPad.     Connecting to an Exchange Server      To connect a Mac to an Exchange server, you’ll need the following   pieces of information from the server administrator:      ul   liThe fully qualified domain name for the organization’s Client   Access    Server (CAS), typically expressed in the format:br   exchange01.example.com./li   liThe Exchange user name, which is generated by the administrator for   each individual user./li   liThe Exchange password, which is also generated for each user. Once    you have the required information, you can either manually configurebr   your Mac to use Exchange, or configure the Mac using the Exchangebr   Autodiscover service, if it’s enabled./li   /ul      Connect to an Exchange server with Autodiscover enabled:      The easiest way to set up Mail, Address Book, and iCal to access   Exchange is the Exchange Autodiscover service. If this feature is   enabled on the Exchange Server, simply open the Add Account pane in   Mail on your Mac and enter your Exchange email address and password.      Mail uses the Autodiscover service in Exchange to obtain the relevant   information and you can start using Exchange services immediately.   <answer33682> iOS does not use Outlook Web Access for Exchange support, it uses ActiveSync.
