Is there any way to have the Screen Sharing app in Snow Leopard to remember the last connected host? <body> I'm wondering if there is an easier way. Currently, I launch Screen Sharing app, and a window appears asking for a host to connect to. I'd like it to already have the host field populated with my last connected host. Is there any way to enable such functionality? Thanks in advance.  <answer9378> Don't know of a way to specifically do that, but you can set up browser bookmarks and/or desktop icons that will connect to specific hosts, if that's any help.    For the former, create a bookmark that points to vnc://hostname.blah.com rather than the more usual http://hostname.blah.com.  For the latter, create a text file with the .command suffix (e.g. 'myvnc.command') that contains the single line:  precodeopen vnc://hostname.blah.com /code/pre  which will start the screen sharing session when you double-click it in Finder. You can also drag it to your dock if you wish.  <answer9385> I used to put the ScreenSharing app icon in my dock, but I found a better way.  Finder's general "Connect to Server" capability is wonderful. Click Finder, or Command-Tab to it, then in the "Go" Menu, choose "Connect to Server". Alternatively, if you're a keyboard freak like me, make Finder active then press kbdCommand/kbd + kbdk/kbd.  Like Calum's suggestion above, the codevnc://hostname.local./code URI is correct. However, this method (using the Connect to Server window) remembers the last server you connected too :).  As an aside, the Connect to Server dialog is infinitely flexible. You can put paths to Samba Shares (smb://), AFP Servers (afp://), VNC/Screen Sharing entries (vnc://), and almost anything with a protocol (except http/https, oddly enough) in there and it'll use it. FTP (ftp://) works, http:// works for Webdav sites, NOT websites, and more.  <answer9386> Another way could be the following:   Once you are connected with screen sharing, take a closer look at title bar of Screen Sharing´s main window. Next to the name of the host you´re connected to, sits a little proxy icon that looks like a document. Click exactly on this tiny icon and drag it to your dock. This will create a file called hostname.vncloc in your dock which you can now click to directly connect to your host.   For additional comfort (if you haven´t done so already), while on the VNC connection prompt, make sure to check the checkbox prompting you to add the username and password you use for VNC to your keychain.  <answer35825> Every time you open a screensharing location, Lion puts an .vncloc file in ~user/Library/Application Support/Screen Sharing. Copy that to your programs folder and make a shortcut in dock. Done!  Note: Lion has Library folder hidden in default. I use the free and easy dashboard widget to hide and show hidden files (thanks Matt): http://web.me.com/hansen.m/Site/Widgets.html http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/hiddenfiles.html
