Do the FireWire ports on the early 2011 MacBook Pros use 4-pin or 9-pin connectors? <body> I've ordered a MacBook Pro (early 2011, 13-inch, 2.3 ghz), to replace my aging and breaking-down iMac G5. I'll need to run a FireWire cable from an audio interface (also on order, that has a 6-pin connector) to the FW 800 port on the MBP.   What size cable should I order? (i.e., 6-pin to 4-pin or 6-pin to 9-pin?)   <answer11914> Any Mac that has Firewire 800, including the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has the 9-pin connector. You will need a 6-pin to 9-pin cable.
