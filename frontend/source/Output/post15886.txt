Is there any license restriction ?  Thanks.  <answer15887> It is required that you be running OS X and you can't virtualize OS X on non-Apple hardware (by terms in the EULA, not for any technical reasons). Therefore it follows that you need a Mac computer to build iPhone software.  See this question and answer for a discussion on virtualizing OS X: Is there a way to evaluate OS X without purchasing Macintosh hardware?  <answer15890> If you want to comply with all Apple's license restrictions, then, yes, you need a Mac to build and sign iOS apps using Apple's latest SDK tools.  <answer15897> Yes, you would have to use a Mac computer.  Running MacOSX as a virtual machine would be against Apple's licensing terms.
