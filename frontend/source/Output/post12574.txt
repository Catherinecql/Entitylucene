Cursor selection behavior <body> When clicking something on the Mac screen, the cursor will   a) take up residence as directed,   If I click again, it will   b) select the whole word,   If I click again, it will  c) select the whole passage.   In Windows, I can click a fourth time, and the cursor will return to "a," the "residence" mode.  On the Mac, it stays in "whole passage" mode. I have to move the cursor out of text, so restore it to "a."  I frequently click a fourth time and expect it to return to mode A. I don't like having to correct this and move the cursor. strongbrHow can I make the fourth click return to mode A, "residence"?/strong  <answer12575> Clicking will reset to the "residence" mode provided that you leave enough time after the previous clicks that it isn't treated as a quadruple click.  At least, that's the way it works for me in Chrome on my MacBook Pro.  <comment13139> correct. Just wait a bit longer, so its not treated as a quadruple.
