Do any iPad e-book readers support sharing excerpts? <body> Are there any e-book readers for iPad that allow the user to highlight a block of text and share it, either by email or blog post?    Use case:   While reading the fifth chapter of emThe Brothers Karamazov/em, the user has an insight into The Grand Inquisitor sequence and wants to blog about it.  The user highlights a sentence and activates a emshare/em feature, and the e-book reader copies the highlighted section into an email, or posts it to Instapaper, with appropriate annotation.  <answer15224> Amazon supports a "public notes" feature.  When you create a note or a highlight on a section using a Kindle or any of their apps, including the iPad app, it's uploaded to the Amazon servers and visible to you at https://kindle.amazon.com/kindle.   From there you can copy and paste into Instapaper or email if you wish.  On that site, you can make your notes public so that other people can see them.
