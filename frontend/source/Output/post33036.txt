How can I diagnose really poor performance of my 13" MBP 2011 on 10.6? <body> The specs are:  ul li2011 MBP 13"/li liCore i7/li li4Gb RAM/li li320Gb HDD (not SSD)/li /ul  I use the system for work everyday, I almost always run the following:  ul liMail.app/li liChrome (7-10 tabs)/li liTerminal (2-3 sessions)/li liSkype/li liTextEdit (2-3 docs)/li liAdium (5 accounts across gTalk, Jabber, MSN)/li liFinder (1-2 windows)/li liPGP Encrypted Drive/li /ul  Occasionally (less than 50% of the time) I also run:  ul liFirefox (2-3 tabs)/li liMAMP (Apache / PHP / MySQL)/li liLibreOffice (1-2 docs)/li liMS Office (1-2 docs)/li /ul  I have a menu bar icon that constantly tells me CPU / Memory usage. Best case scenario, almost after I've booted up and turned on the minimum amount of my always on apps, I'm using 2-2.5gb RAM.   After a few hours I'll be up around 3gb and it'll generally stay around that point, where loading any app seems to be much slower than required and try to run heavier stuff like Excel / Calc or VMWare Fusion is almost unusable and takes years to actually get up and running.  Once the memory gets 3gb+, I often get system freezes (throbbing mouse, no apps respond) for 5-10 seconds, and a massive spike in CPU Usage for the 5-10 second period.  I'm in an office of about 10 people, and all of us run very similar applications, including the PGP Disk Encryption.  I'm wondering if anybody could give pointers on improving performance, or how to diagnose poor performance on OSX? At home I'm a Windows/Ubuntu person, and I feel like I've figured out how to diagnose any performance issues I get on those platforms, but in the OSX world I feel totally inexperienced.  Thanks for any tips.  <answer33093> These are generally the things that I do whenever I have issues with performance. Make sure you have a full backup first, of course.  ul liClose all apps. Open Disk Utility, and click 'Macintosh HD' (or whatever your OS X hard drive is named) on the left hand side. Then click verify disk. Let it do its thing, and if it comes back with green text saying that the disk is fine, groovy. If not, locate your original Mac OS X disc that came with your machine. Insert the disc, turn your computer off. Press the power button again, then immediately hold the 'c' key down. This will boot your computer from the CD. When it has loaded, select the language, and then click (on the top menu bar) Utilities - Disk Utility. Within this, select your OS X hard disk, and click 'Repair disk.' This may take some time to complete. When it has finished repairing, restart your computer into OS X. /li liThen go back into Disk Utility, select your disk, and click 'Repair Disk Permissions.' Again this may take some time. /li liIf you don't already have it, get Onyx (here). Open it up, and click the 'cleaning' tab. Select and execute whatever caches or histories you wish to clear. They are all safe to clear, causing no change to your laptop, just apps may require a few seconds longer to start immediately after the clean. /li liMake sure that your hard disk is not full of junk that you do not need, and is not too full. Empty the trash. /li /ul  You should hopefully notice an increase in battery life as well after these processes.   Hope this helps!  <answer33103> When the wired and active RAM pass 50% - most tasks are measurably slower. You will see increased paging activity (codevm_stat 15/code in the terminal - watch for page outs - they indicate some memory had to be written to slow hard drive and constant page out and page in above 10-20 per minute indicates you have a RAM starved system.)  When starved for RAM, you can buy more or do less. You might want to get a monitoring software like Activity Monitor and keep the memory indicator in your dock. The system is likely thrashing based on the time delays you report. Each of the active programs needs some memory that just got paged to disk to free up extra space for memory needed by another program. It is a bad cycle and the computer just spends time running circles rather than getting done the work you wanted.  Here is a mac with every indication of RAM pressure:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZRlg.png" alt="time for more RAM"  But, quitting a large app like Aperture and starting it again still has no paging and the system is very responsive. Ignore the first line after the headings in vm_stat as it's the total since boot, but do watch for pageout as you have apps that are not responsive:  precodemac:~ me$ vm_stat 15 Mach Virtual Memory Statistics: (page size of 4096 bytes, cache hits 0%)   free active   spec inactive   wire   faults     copy    0fill reactive  pageins  pageout 260482  1186K  74303   275275 234520  323478K  2276158  188709K   120292   640158      482  260689  1187K  74303   275275 234038     4117        0     3256        0        0        0  261310  1185K  74001   275250 235835    10668       77     7115        0        4        0  292087  1153K  74711   274313 236770    32927      972    21684        0       18        0  521469 928347  75754   269861 235897    77208      130    63300        8       41        0  517897 936518  75766   269215 231981    27678     2504    13059        0       22        0  463894 987202  72076   274852 233371   126855     2712    89422        2       50        0  223701  1180K  77834   283568 265396   589512      255   562957        1     7278        0  205013  1186K  82765   291561 265293   389442      255   369664        0     7334        0  201401  1173K  89671   301672 265595   495426       82   472316        1     9286        0  /code/pre  However, starting about 4 of the Adobe CS4 apps can push this machine into thrashing and the slowness you describe with the apps taking 30 seconds to launch and lots of bouncing of square icons in the dock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DRkp3.png" alt="dock bounce"  Here is the associated codevm_stat 15/code showing the problem.

Things get slow when the system doesn't have enough room make its temp files on the disk. <comment37799> Hmmm 21Gb free, assuming that there is a page file already present, so I don't think I'm quite at that point yet. <comment72965> Well written question, +1 <comment72982> Eventually I upgraded from 4 - 8gb, and it runs like brand new again :). Good points about RAM usage and thrashing. <comment73067> +1 for details of diagnosis and solution.
