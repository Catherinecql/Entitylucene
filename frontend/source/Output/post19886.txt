Automater/Applescript page viewer/downloader loop <body> I have some 9500 individual audio files I am trying to download which:  a) require a login to a website  b) are located at subdirectories which ?redirects? to a download link  (eg. www.whatever.com/product/download/id/1234 == prompt to download the whatever-file-name.mp3)  Can someone help me write a applescript/automator app that will visit "http://www.blah.com/product/download/id/1" wait until download finishes, +1 then visit: http://www.blah.com/product/download/id/2 loop until 9600  <answer19969> set theint to 1 set theurl to "http://blah.com/"  repeat until theint = 6     tell application "Google Chrome"         set URL of active tab of window 1 to theurl &amp; theint         activate     end tell     set theint to theint + 1     delay 5 end repeat  works fine so far.. need to change 5s delay to something like 'when download finishes'.. any help?
