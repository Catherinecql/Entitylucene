iPad virtual keyboard text entry: Can I disable the automatic upper-casing that takes place after I end a sentence? <body> When using the iPad to type a note, for instance, every time I type a period, the iPad assumes I want to start the next word with a capital letter.  It also assumes I want to start typing with a capital letter in some text fields on web forms.  Is there any way to turn off the automatic SHIFT that is taking place, so there are only capital letters where I explicitly want them to be?  <answer155> ol liGo to settings/li liGo to general/li liGo to keyboard/li liToggle and disable auto-capitalization/li /ol
