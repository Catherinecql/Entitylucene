Entourage window resizing issue <body> Could someone tell me how to retain the email window to the full page size eachtime I open entourage.?  When I open the new email window it opens in a small window, in then have to drag the window to use it comfortably.  I close down reataining these sizes and when I open the entourage later it always goes back to the small window!  It is driving me crazy?  <answer8242> It's most likely that your Entourage preferences file is corrupted in some fashion. Try this:  ol liClose Entourage. /li liNavigate to code~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Entourage.plist/code./li liMove the file to the Desktop. /li liOpen Entourage, resize the window to your preferred size. Entourage will automatically make a new preferences file. /li liClose and open Entourage again to test that the change sticks./li /ol  If all is well, you can trash the original codecom.microsoft.Entourage.plist/code file from your Desktop.
