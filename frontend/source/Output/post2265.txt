Autotiling for Mac OS X <body> I love the big screen on the iMacs, but having to shape the applications so they don't overlap is not optimal. Is there a way to have an autotiling feature, so that with the touch of a (configurable mouse) button the windows get tiled automatically ?  <answer2271> Although your question is not an exact duplicate, it basically covers Window Management, so I suggest you take a look at this and this.
