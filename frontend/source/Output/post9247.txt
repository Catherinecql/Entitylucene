How to set up equal height columns with a title on top (Pages '09) <body> This is what I'm trying to do on Pages '09 — http://cl.ly/4sJ2 — two equal height columns with a title on top. Any suggestions?  <answer9249> I don't have access to Pages at the moment (I'm on an old Macbook on a travel) but a quick fix to your problem would be to set up a text box on top that doesn't allow text to be under it and expand it to cover both columns.   With that said, I'm sure there's a way to set up the columns to behave like that in a more "correct" way, but you'll have to wait until tuesday for me to get back, been offline for almost 30 days and I haven't touched Pages in a while :)  <answer9251> I just got it to work — inserted a layout break after my headline and set it up as a one-column layout and the rest of the content as a two-column layout. Applied some padding to it and it's perfect.  <answer121662> page layout- page breaks- continues  <comment9787> That would also work, though I don't seem as an appropriate semantic solution to use on a big fat imortant document, as a masters thesis. A good solution, though ;)
