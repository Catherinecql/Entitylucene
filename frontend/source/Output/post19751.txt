Mirror iPad 2 screen on Mac <body> I would like to know if there is a possibility to display the iPad 2 screen on my Mac? You know, silmilar to the Steve Jobs presentations.  Thank you for your help.  <answer19760> Not on your Mac, but you can use and HDMI or VGA cable to a separate monitor that will then mirror the iPad2 display.  <answer19764> Yes. If your device is jailbroken, then you can use apps like Veency to mirror. Actually there are lot of apps available in cydia.  <answer19765> You'd need a composite cable from Apple to get the input to your monitor. You might need a converter from composite to draw input.  You would need a HDMI slot to use your Mac as input AFAIK   <answer19921> If you can get a Mac app that can receive AirPlay streams you should be able to use AirPlay mirroring, the same way you would for an apple TV.  AirPlayer http://ericasadun.com/ftp/Macintosh/ is one example of this but it doesn't seem to work for me.  <answer47643> Reflector should fulfill your needs.
