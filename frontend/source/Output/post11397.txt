Indicates fully charged when not 100% <body> I recently (less than 1 month ago) purchased a new Macbook Pro 13". Love it so far, but have a question on the battery. It never reaches 100% - usually it makes it up to 96% then the light on the charger goes from amber to green, and the charging indicator says "fully charged".  I've tried recalibrating the battery as described here.  Should I just take it to the Apple Store and have someone look at it? Is this a typical behavior?  <answer11406> My 17" Macbook Pro battery, is at 95% after 260 cycles!  So this is not normal for such a new battery.  You should go to an Apple Store and probably they will replace it for you!  From Apple website:     The built-in battery of your MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is designed to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before it reaches 80 percent of its original capacity.   <comment80412> are you sure? I think the battery does show a 100% indicator but drains out sooner, when its capacity decreases.
