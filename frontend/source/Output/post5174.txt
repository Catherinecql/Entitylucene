HDTV only detected when turned off (connected via DisplayPort to HDMI) <body> I tried to connect my LG HDTV (42" LD650) to my MacBook Pro 13" (mid-2010) using a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. When I plug the cable in, my MacBook's screen flickers every time but the TV is only detected when it is in standby mode. Its status will switch to "No Display Connected" the moment I turn it on.  Here is what System Profiler shows when the TV is in standby mode:  pre NVIDIA GeForce 320M:    Chipset Model: NVIDIA GeForce 320M   Type: GPU   Bus: PCI   VRAM (Total): 256 MB   Vendor: NVIDIA (0x10de)   Device ID: 0x08a0   Revision ID: 0x00a2   ROM Revision: 3533   Displays: Color LCD:   Resolution: 1280 x 800   Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)   Main Display: Yes   Mirror: Off   Online: Yes   Built-In: Yes LG TV:   Resolution: 1920 x 1080 @ 50 Hz   Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)   Mirror: Off   Online: Yes   Rotation: Supported   Television: Yes /pre  I tried the TV and HDMI cable using a Windows PC and it worked instantly.  Is my TV somehow incompatible with the MacBook Pro, or is my adapter faulty, or am I doing something wrong?  <answer5182> While the TV is on standby, try going into System Preferences  Displays Preferences and set your displays to mirror.   <answer5566> Are you using a graphics card switching app like gfxCardStatus?  I had a similar problem when I first started connecting to my tv because I was set to use Intel graphics only.  The Intel graphics chipset doesn't support HDMI output.   I see in your system profiler output the NVidia card, but I'm wondering if you're still somehow switched to the Intel...  <answer6016> I just bought a new adapter (same type/manufacture) and updated to EFI 2.0 - the problem is fixed, now.   <comment5283> Thanks for your answer - unfortunately enabling the mirror option didn't work. The TV is still disappearing from the Displays Preferences when it's turned on. <comment5910> No, I'm using the 13" MacBook Pro without Intel graphics.
