Windows 8 on the iPad? <body> I was just watching the Windows 8 keynote and Steven Sinofsky said 8 will be able to run on ARM CPUs, which are also used in iDevices.   So I'm curious, would it be possible to run 8 on an iPad, similar to how iDroid works?  <answer24975> Yes it is possible but it will not be easy. You will probably need to jailbreak your iPad and follow similar procedures when installing Android.
