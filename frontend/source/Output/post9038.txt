OS X Automator send mail <body> I would like to create an Automator application that reads the address book and sends an email from the default email account with the content of the addr. book search result.  Everything works except before sending the email the use is asked to press the send button. Is it possible to achieve this with no user interaction ?   <answer9042> You can make a Do AppleScript block, and use AppleScript to tell Mail to click the Send menu item.  Directions here.  <answer9047> you can directly do an applescript to send an email and call it from automator:  precode   tell application "Mail"       activate       set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {account:"Account Detail", subject:"Mail Subject", content:"Content"}       tell newMessage           make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:theRecipient}         set visible to true       end tell       send newMessage     end tell /code/pre  You would just need to get theRecipient from the input passed to the AppleScript action. Also, you need to replace the properties on the third line with details of your Mail account.  precodeset theRecipient to (item 1 of input) /code/pre  should do it.
