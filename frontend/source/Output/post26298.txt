Stylus for Multitouch (Laptop) Trackpad? <body> I remember seeing a stylus that was available for the multitouch (laptop) trackpad. I'm learning a new language right now so it would be rather useful to be able to use a stylus to 'write' instead of using my fingers.  <answer26301> Take a look at the oStylus Capacitive Drawing Stylus:  http://ostylus.com/  Engadget's review specifically mentions and shows the stylus being used with Apple's Magic Trackpad.  http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/01/ostylus-capacitive-pen-review/
