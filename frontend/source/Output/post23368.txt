How can I use a non-amplified mic on a MBP? <body> How do I use a non-amplified/powered mic on a MBP? Or is it not possible without an amplifier/interface. I don't really want to get an amplifier or USB/Firewire interface, but if I have to, I will.  <answer23377> You can't get good results with an unpowered microphone without a cable adapter or USB interface. The best bet is to purchase one of the many USB to audio interface dongles available. A favorite of mine is this one from Monoprice in California, which costs under $10. It includes a stereo headphone output and a mono mic input. It will also handle  powered microphones, such as the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 lavaliere mic. I have two of these mics, and they offer excellent value for money (about $20).  <comment26110> Thanks so much. I think I will end up with one of those lavalier mics. Awesome price!
