Upgrading Xserve hard drives <body> Will 3Tb SATA hard drives work in Xserve (Model Xserve1,1) and allow all the space to be allocated.  <answer19737> This may be third-hand information, from this page of specs, but:     Apple reports that this Xserve supports "any combination of SATA or SAS Apple Drive Modules: up to 2.25 TB using three 750 GB 7200 RPM SATA drive modules; or up to 900 GB using three 300 GB 15,000 RPM SAS drive modules."   <answer19741> If you configured it with an Apple RAID card then no, you are limited to 2.25gb drives, but if it doesn't have a RAID card then you're fine.   https://support.apple.com/specs/xserve/Xserve_Late_2006.html  To identify your model, if you have a RAID card or not, look here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1346  <comment21764> You're probably aware that the Apple drives have custom firmware that sometimes work better with the fan control and error reporting. Just a FYI. :-)
