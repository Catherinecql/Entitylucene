How do I disable Ping? <body> Although I do like and enjoy using iTunes, I'm not a fan of the new Ping service that Apple has embedded into it.   Is it possible to disable the Ping link under "Store", the Ping sidebar, and the Ping buttons next to each song? If so, how?  <answer4531> If you dont like playing with the command line, I advise you to install strongSecret/strong.  With this Preferences pane, you'll have access to hidden settings for a lot of applications (from Apple and third parties).  Then, all you have to do is go to the iTunes section and search for "Ping", like so: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSD5k.png" alt="preference pane secret"  If you know your way around Terminal.app, here are the commands:  precodedefaults write com.apple.iTunes hide-ping-dropdown -bool TRUE /code/pre  and   precodedefaults write com.apple.iTunes disablePingSidebar 1 /code/pre  Switch to code-bool FALSE/code and codedisablePingSidebar 0/code to if you want the default value again.  <answer4532> In iTunes 10.1, there’s a setting for that:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JlTUx.jpg" alt="alt text"  Additionally you can set a parental control that also disables Ping.   <answer4537> You can also restore the old arrow functionality  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mSWuS.jpg" alt="alt text"  precodedefaults write com.apple.iTunes show-store-link-arrows 1 /code/pre  I also suggest the following:  precodedefaults write com.apple.iTunes invertStoreLinks 1 /code/pre     This setting switches the default   behaviour of the arrow links. By   default (well, by default in iTunes   10.0.0 and before) the arrows would send the user to the corresponding   page in the iTunes Store, but you   could also hold down Opt and click to   be redirected to the corresponding   list in your own library.      Now, to reset it all to Apple's   defaults... you can either do the same   lines as above but replacing '1' with   '0', or you can delete the settings by   changing "write" to "delete" and   removing the 1 from the end:   precodedefaults delete com.apple.iTunes disablePingSidebar  defaults delete com.apple.iTunes hide-ping-dropdown  defaults delete com.apple.iTunes show-store-link-arrows  defaults delete com.apple.iTunes invertStoreLinks /code/pre  restart when done.  I blogged about this when I read Tom Gidden's article  <comment4374> brilliant, thanks! <comment4703> I hate that they give no choices for being anonymous.  Why do I have to use my real full name to sign up?
