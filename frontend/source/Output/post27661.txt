App for File store and viewer <body> I am looking at an ipad app which can be used to store files locally as well as supports multiple types for viewing. E.g. Doc, xls, ppt, etc  I heard Goodreader is one such app, but was looking for something free..  <answer27665> What about Documents 2 Free. I use it and I like it.  http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/documents-2-free-spreadsheet/id314894105?mt=8  Although it's not an ipad only app.  <answer27678> Dropbox can store files locally and also sync files with other device, and it support a lot of file formats i.e. doc, xls, ppt. And it's free
