Is Apple throttling web apps on iPhone? <body> According to the Register Apple is throttling web apps:     If a web app is run from the iOS 4.3 home screen – in other words, if   it is saved to the screen alongside local apps downloaded from the   Apple App Store – and launched into full-screen mode, it runs roughly   two to two and a half times slower than it does in the browser,   according to various tests. It appears that whereas Apple has updated   the iOS 4.3 Safari browser with its high-speed Nitro JavaScript   engine, Nitro is not used when web apps are launched from the home   screen.   Is this true?  <answer25482> It's more that Safari was being boosted in 4.3 and that that boost was not available to Web Apps on the homescreen  According to ArsTechnica this is fixed in iOS 5.
