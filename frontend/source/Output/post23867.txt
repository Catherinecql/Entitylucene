Can I select the architecture of a program from the command line? <body> Many of the unix executable binary programs are delivered with more than one architecture:  precodemac:~ mike$ file `which bc` /usr/bin/bc: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures /usr/bin/bc (for architecture x86_64):  Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64 /usr/bin/bc (for architecture i386):    Mach-O executable i386 /code/pre  Is there a way I can select or force a specific architecture to run (mainly for testing to explore the effects that some larger programs or longer running processes have when executing the same workload over different codebases / memory capabilities?)   <answer23869> You can use the arch program to select which architecture of a universal binary to run.  If you wanted to use the 32-bit version of the executable:  precodearch -arch i386 /usr/bin/bc /code/pre  And if you wanted the 64-bit version of the executable:  precodearch -arch x86_64 /usr/bin/bc /code/pre  Note this doesn't work with applications (folders that end in code.app/code and have manifests and what not so OS X recognizes them as emapplications/em), just universal binaries. If you had a app with multiple architectures you'd want to use Launch Services to launch it with a specific architecture.
