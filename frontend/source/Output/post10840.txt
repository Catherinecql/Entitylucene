Preventing other network users installing Remote Desktop 3 via the AppStore <body> I have installed Remote Desktop 3 (purchased from the AppStore) on my administrators machine. However, if one of our employees installs Remote Desktop 3 themselves onto their machine on the network via the App Store, how I can prevent them also accessing all the machines on our network?    Or will I have to disable admin access to everyone's machines other than mine on the network?    <answer10848> How are they supposed to know the login credentials for the other machines? And if they emdo know/em the credentials, they could probably do whatever they want with ssh, vnc, afp, etc… anyway, so no need to prohibit ARD, really.  To make it more precise: if you cannot trust your users not to spy on each other, don´t let them know each others passwords!
