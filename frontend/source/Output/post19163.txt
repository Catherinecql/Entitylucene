Is there a minimum running configuration for OS X? <body> I'd like to run just the bare essentials in Lion while I read up on what is new, where the docs are, and how to lock it down.  Is there a base set or 'stripped down' list of apps that I could run while adding more as I see fit?  EDIT:  8GB Ram, core 2 duo LP64 Kernel. Before I asked this question I installed 2x, over top of Snow Leopard, then on a clean drive.   h2One of the solutions:/h2  I did the NVRAM, the SMC, single user fsck, bootstrapped launchd, dumped memory ( the diagnostic tools emare/em nice. )   Hardware and memory checked out fine.  Oddly, it did not even show a lot of load. That's quite odd because the fans blast spin up and then POP ... kernel panic. Full speed for hours.  But I found the culprit:  precodeJul 29 09:58:48 8va com.apple.mdworker.pool.0[177]: PSSniffer error: No such file or directory /serveradmin Jul 29 13:59:04 8va mds[83]: (/)(Warning) IndexQuery in bool preIterate_FSI(SISearchCtx_FSI*):Throttling inefficient file system query Jul 29 13:59:19: --- last message repeated 1 time --- Jul 29 13:59:19 8va Firewall[112]: *** process 112 exceeded 500 log message per second limit  -  remaining messages this second discarded *** Jul 29 13:59:24 8va servermgrd[77]: servermgr_ipfilter:ipfw config:Notice:Flushed IPv4 rules /code/pre  strongI had servermgrd from the very beginning.

Now, I tried that earlier, but did not have success.  Those were the services I wanted to stop, now the OS is no longer wrecking my hardware.   This was a totally clean install. To be fair, I installed the first time before the supplemental 10.6.8 patches, maybe its a finicky upgrade path. Who knows...  <answer19172> Mac OS isnt quite like Windows or Linux in that aspect, you cant run a "bare bones" version of Lion, nor a "Starter" version. Mac OS X Lion comes in a single version with all features.  As of minimum system requirements, Apple is pretty straight forward with that too. You need a mac with Intel Core 2 Duo at least. You also need 2GB of RAM, but I'd say most macs with a Core 2 Duo already have that covered. If not you can upgrade your memory.   To check your hardware click on the strongApple Menu/strong, select strongAbout This Mac/strong, and then strongMore Info/strong.  As for apps, most apps just require you to be running a certain OS. Usually just games or heavy professional apps require minimum processor speeds/RAM memory.  For more info on Lion's Specs, go ahead and check:  http://www.apple.com/macosx/specs.html  Hope its useful.  Kevin  <comment20977> Not sure I understand what you're asking. The most bare bones install would be to erase the target volume and install Lion fresh. You could then download/install apps as you needed/wanted. <comment20994> "Mac OS X Lion comes in a single version with all features." Actually, it is much more "bare-bones" than it was before. Some features are downloaded as needed after the install now. <comment20998> The only one I've heard of so far is XCode... which other features? I am planing to migrate to Lion soon and would like to know how much I'd have to download :/ <comment21000> printer drivers as well <comment21005> Java is another thing that gets downloaded the first time you need it. Strangely it doesn't get triggered all the time. While typing java on the shell in Terminal.app or opening TV-Browser (an app for tv schedules) it worked fine, it failed when opening NetBeans. But hey, we're a 1.0 ;-) <comment21008> and speech packs <comment21172> I actually did that. The default is to run a ton of stuff, and it's kernel panic'ing my laptop. <comment21177> I'd read the apple forums. It's shaky enough that don't want to tempt fate and run Chrome, or virtualbox :( The recovery partition is nice though. <comment21424> Not surprising indeed. Apple does the same for extra iDVD themes and the first Garageband Jampack, which is free for download from within Garageband. After all, its lots of data you a user might never need in its whole life...  Problems with Chrome and virtualbox? D:
