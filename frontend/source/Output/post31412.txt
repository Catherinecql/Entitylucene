How can I install iPhone Simulator 4.2 on Xcode 4.2? <body> Developer Information:  Version:  4.2 (4D199)   Location: /Developer   Applications:   Xcode:    4.2 (828)   Instruments:  4.2 (4233)   Dashcode: 3.0.2 (336)   SDKs:   Mac OS X:   10.6: (10K549)   10.7: (11C63)   iPhone OS:   5.0:  (9A334)   iPhone Simulator:   4.3:  (8H7)   5.0:  (9A334)  As you see, Xcode4.2 is installed and this supports iOS4.3, 5.0 simulator.br How can I test app for iOS4.2?br Should I install Xcode 3.x?  Thanks in advance.  <answer31418> http://www.touch-code-magazine.com/installing-4-3-iphone-simulator-in-xcode-4-2/  Looks trivial.  Just repeat the steps for 4.2  <answer31515> If you have an iPhone OS 3.x device, and you plan to test on device, then you don't need to install Xcode 3 or Xcode 4.0 or Xcode 4.1 as Xcode 4.2 has an optional (look under Xcode 4.2 Preferences - Downloads tab - Components tab) install that you just need to download.  If you don't have an iPhone 0S 3.x device, and wants to use the simulator, you can install an earlier Xcode (that has the simulator you want) at a different path than the Xcode 4.2.  Do not install both using the default path or at the same path as it may make your development environment unstable and "sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools" won't help then.

I have instead linked to an open-to-the-public Apple discussion that contains the direct download link/li liMount the .dmg file/li liInside the disk image there is an invisible "Packages" folder. To open it select "Go to folder..." command from Finder menu bar and digit the path "/Volumes/Xcode and iOS SDK/Packages/"/li liNow double-click "iPhoneSimulatorSDK4_2.pkg"/li liClick into the destination disk and a button "Select folder..." will be revealed/li liClick the above button and select your "Developer" folder/li liInstall the package, and Restart Xcode./li /ul  This will install the Simulator 4.2 SDK (both iPad and iPhone) inside the folder  "/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/"  Now inside XCode 4.2 you can select this simulator from the menu.  Bye.  <answer41996> its very simple  you have Xcode 4.2.1   open xcode  preferences Downloads (tab)  and you should have a list of the simulators to download and install   Enjoy   <answer52291> The answer given above didn't quite work for me; I never got a select-folder button, and the 4.2 simulator ended up in code/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/code, which is not where the 4.2 and 5.0 simulators live; and though I restarted Xcode, no 4.2 simulator appeared there.  I manually moved it next to the others (in code/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/code), using codesudo mv/code in Terminal.  Then I restarted Xcode again, but still no 4.2 simulator.  At the moment, I'm stumped.  <comment36011> The OP is referring to 4.2 not the 4.3 simulator that comes with Xcode 4.0 <comment36012> Thank you. But 4.3 iPhone simulator is installed already on Xcode as developer information.  I want to install 4.2 iPhone simulator but I don't know how to install that. <comment36820> I think after installation you need to restart the Xcode. If I am correct, please do add it to your answer :-) <comment49079> how many and which simulators do you see in your xcode? <comment49289> the 5.0 simulator should be installed by default (for ipad/iphone), so as for the list in the downloads tab you should have : 1- IOS 4.3 Simulator 2- IOS 4.0 -4.1 Device Debugging Support 3- IOS 3.0 - 3.2.2 Device Debugging Support Just make sure that you are using the right "Deployment target" in the Project property (TARGETS) hope this helps <comment59820> I should add that I'm running 10.7 (Lion); the /Developer folder is no longer very relevant.
