How to disable coalescing of log messages in OS X? <body> I've been using Console to debug some things on my Mac, and I keep seeing code--- last message repeated one time ---/code in the log.  Apparently it's not really essential, and you can turn it off on the command line with the -dup_delay switch on syslogd (see here).  But how do I do that so it turns it off in the Console app?  I don't want to start syslogd again, I just want to change a setting on the currently running process.  <answer6664> The Console application is simply reading the log files.  I suspect running syslogd with that flag will cure your problem, as syslogd will then write the log files differently..
