How to edit videos keeping existing geotagging? <body> Videos recorded with an iPhone or with other GPS-enabled phones gets geotagged as they should. When I trim/crop/edit them in iMovie (iLife '09) the GPS tags are gone.  How to keep the tags despite editing or is there a program to add back the geotags to the movie afterwards?  <answer3339> You can geotag videos with Picasa, but I don't know if the geotag is saved along with the file...  <answer17120> You can download the free app GeoCam Pro in the App Store. This app allows you to upload the video to the site veryminute.com and add the video to your  iPhone's library. I think the tags will be also synced.
