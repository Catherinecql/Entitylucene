How can I edit Address Book distribution lists? <body> In Snow Leopard there was a way to select which address to use for each contact in a group, for sending group emails or printing address lists. This was done by selecting the group in the groups column and choosing strongEdit/strong → strongEdit Distribution List…/strong  In the (horrible) Lion Address Book, the feature is still in the Edit menu, but I can't figure out why it's always dimmed. What are the circumstances when this menu item should become available, or how can I choose the addresses for my contact groups in Lion?  <answer32277> Only local groups (appearing in On My Mac) support distribution lists. This feature won't work if you're only using Exchange, a CardDAV server, or iCloud.  Here's a cnet article about this, with regard to iCloud: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20126108-263/address-book-distribution-list-editor-disabled-by-icloud/  <comment87723> That is a serious drag.  Address Book is getting worse and worse.
