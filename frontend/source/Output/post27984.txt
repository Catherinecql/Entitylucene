If I buy a Mac that comes with Lion, can I install it on my old Macs too? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Does buying a new mac also get you Lion on your Apple ID?       If I buy a new Mac with OS X Lion, will I then be able to update my old computers to Lion via the Mac App Store without charge?  <answer27987> No - macs ship with one license to Lion - for that mac.  If you buy an upgrade outright, that applies to all your macs.
