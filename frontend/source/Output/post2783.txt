Turn layout in Pages into a template <body> I have a layout in Pages that I want to turn into a template. Here is what I have so far:  img src="https://imgur.com/w6J1e.png" alt="Screenshot Hosted on Imgur.com"  The green rectangle is an inserted shape.  I'd like to use that as a title bar basically and put text on top of it.  The other thing, I'd like to be able to do create a "title" template of sorts and whenever I need a title page, insert that template page and go from there.  How do I do this?  <answer2826> When you have a Pages document, you can always go to File - Save as Template  After you’ve saved it, whenever you chose New - From Template Chooser, you have a small section that says “My Templates”:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QTckb.png" alt="Template Chooser"  Your “Custom” templates should appear there.  For the second part of your question, what you need is what Pages call a strongsection/strong. The steps for creating a new section are pretty straightforward and you can find a lot of information on google, see samples here and here (find the part where a new section is created).  In short: Insert a “Section Break”, edit it, change the styles, add what you want (see the links to see tips about different things you can do, like having a different ‘first page’ than the rest, etc.).  Once you’re happy with your “section”, make sure the ‘caret’ (cursor) is blinking in emany part of the section/em and go to Format - Advanced - Capture Pages:  The result is a sheet dialog like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xEqhk.jpg" alt="Capture Pages"  Give it a name, make sure it includes the pages you want (1, 2, 3 or all, depending upon the complexity of your idea, in your case it would be ‘First Page Only’) and finally save the document as a “Template”.  The page(s) you’ve used to create a Section can be safety deleted before you save the template (unless you want your template to always start with those pages by default), because you have captured them as a section, they will always be available under the new template.
