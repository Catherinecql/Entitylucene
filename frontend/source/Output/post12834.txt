WiFi problem after 4.3.2 jailbreak <body> I've just jailbroken my iPhone (3Gs, 5.13.04, iOS 4.3.2, Pwnage Tool 4.3.2).   Now I'm experiencing troubles with WiFi, so I can't do an unlock. I have an AirPort Express router, it works well with other devices, the iPhone does have connection with the router (in the Settings - Wifi menu there is a checkmark in front of my network) but there is no indication of WiFi connection and none of my applications see this connection.  How can I solve this problem?  Thanks in advance.  <answer12938> I've found a solution, it is not pretty clear, but it works.   First, I've rebooted my router  Second, in codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Network/code I've set codeCellular Data/code and codeEnable 3G/code to OFF. After that operation WiFi indicator appeared and everything went well.   Hope it helps to those who experience the same problem.
