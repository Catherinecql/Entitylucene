iTunes/Mp3-Player and actual multi-tagging of MP3s <body> I search for a software to allow multi-tagging. Meaning, i want to add more than one genre to a song/album to be able to easily access specific songs i.e. ("female singer, jazz" or "duet, jazz") which i can not realy do by choosing just one genre.  Is there an option to do this with iTunes? If not, is there a player able to do this? Maybe even with pandora/last.fm/musicbrains interface so i don't even have to tag all the songs myself?  <answer24369> For a thorough analyse of the topic, read Ways to store multiple genres in your digital music, where Dan says:     MP3. MP3s (or rather, the ID3 tagging format used by MP3s) don't support multiple tags for genre. Instead you must useone existing tag and use a delimiter character to separate the genres within that tag.    If you use iTunes player, I'd recommend to use the codeGrouping/code tag for that purpose.    Now, can you do that automatically ?br As you pointed out, Last.fm offers an interface to retrieve tags for songs. And bdefore used that API to develop an iTunes Multi-Genre Tagger (description blog post here, last version of the script here). I think that's the tool you're after.  <comment27490> Thanks a lot for so much Information! I will look into that!
