How do I extract Parallels Desktop's dock icon? <body> Parallels Desktop has ugly red bars on its icon. How can I remove those bars?  <answer32458> First, see this article. It eliminates the red bar well.  Anyway dock icon when Parallels is not running shows bad icon. You can replace this icon in app's resource folder. Anyway we don't have the clean icon now. To get the clean icon, follow these steps.  ol liFind Parallels Desktop's PID./li liRun GDB as superuser. Attach to Parallels Desktop./li liExecute Objective-C that saves code for current dock icon image into a file./li /ol  See this console log.  precodeHoons-MacBook-Air:~ Eonil$ ps -A | grep Parallels\ Desktop  4223 ??         0:01.79 /Applications/Parallels Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/prl_client_app -psn_0_950504  4259 ttys007    0:00.00 grep Parallels Desktop Hoons-MacBook-Air:~ Eonil$ sudo gdb GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1708) (Thu Nov  3 21:59:02 UTC 2011) Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

This hack will extract emcurrent/em icon. So if you want to extract other icon, just make your Parallels to show the other icon and use this hack at the time.
