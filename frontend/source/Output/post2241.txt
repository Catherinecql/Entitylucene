What can I do once my jailbroken iPhone gets a data plan attached by AT&T? <body> I noticed my phone bill had a data plan attached this month to my jailbroken iPhone -- is there any way to get around this?  <answer2242> You're going to have to talk to AT&amp;T and have them remove the data plan, unless you're under contract for a data plan (as all new iPhones are) they should be able to take it off your next bill. Jailbreaking really doesn't have anything to do with this.
