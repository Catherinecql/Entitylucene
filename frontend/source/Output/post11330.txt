Google Voice messenger notification problem <body> I have an iPhone 4 with the Google Voice messenger app. However I don't get notifications at all; I've tried everything! If I want to check if I recieved a text I have to go into the app and press the refresh button. Any suggestions?  <answer43125> It would be probably a bug with the app. Can you check that you have notifications on for this app, by going into the following setting:  Home Screen  Settings  Notifications  GV Messenger.  Additionally the GV Messenger is not the official Google voice app. You may want to use the official Google Voice app.
