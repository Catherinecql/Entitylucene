Share Web through another port <body> I have a webserver running on a MBA at port 4431 and I want to access through my local network.  But web sharing uses port 80 by default and I can't access to my_mba_ip:4431  Can I add ports to web sharing? I found this old, old post (Changing the OS X Web Server Port) where seems the solution to my problem, but I don't know how to do that in Lion :(  <answer33027> The location of the httpd.conf in lion is the following:   precode/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf /code/pre  And you will search for the line to change that has the following:   precodeListen 80 /code/pre  The rest of that document you linked should work.  I would however recommend using MAMP for much better control of apache and mysql.   MAMP
