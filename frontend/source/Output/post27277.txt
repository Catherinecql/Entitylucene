Will I have to create separate Apple IDs for two iOS devices to message each other? <body> I have one Apple ID that I use for both my iPhone and my wife's iPhone. In iOS5, if we want to message to each other using iMessage, will one of us need to create a separate AppleID? And if so, will that affect apps that we've downloaded to the device using the other Apple ID?  <answer27280> You don't have to create separate Apple ID's for the iPhone because iMessage also works by using the phone number.   However if you have two wi-fi only iPad's or iPod touch's then you will just have to use separate e-mail address.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sOklh.png" alt="There you have it"
