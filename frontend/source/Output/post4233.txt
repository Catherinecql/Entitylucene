Mail.app doesn't delete the draft email after I have sent it <body> I use Mail.app to access my Gmail account and it doesn't delete the draft email - which is created automatically - after I have sent it. How do I correct this?  <answer4250> See point #18 on this TidBITS article on making Mail.app and Gmail IMAP co-exist happily -- hopefully it will help?  (I have not yet taken all the recommendations they give, but the longer I go on using both, the more I turn back to this to help file off the rough edges.)
