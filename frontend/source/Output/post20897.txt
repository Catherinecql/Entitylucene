iPhone configuation utility for Windows not working <body> I am using the iPhone Configuration Utility 3.3 and I had an iPad plugged in - while trying to deploy a profile, the application just crashed.  After this, I attempted to launch it several times but it would just crash immediately.  I looked through the ipcu.log file and saw that it had problems with a cryptographic key. I used Microsoft/Sysinternals Process Monitor and tracked down the key it tried to open and deleted it.  After doing this, I reopened the utility and it recreated a key and launched fine.  From here, I can create profiles, but when I try to install them on a device, nothing happens at all on the device, but going in to the console view, I see the device reporting this:  precodeMon Aug  8 11:41:52 wils-iPod mc_mobile_tunnel[341] &lt;Warning&gt;: MC|mc_mobile_tunnel starting.

I have run this tool on another machine with the same device and configuration profile and it works just fine. This is just on this one machine.  I have tried reinstalling without any luck and cannot find the file that it is trying to load. Based on the invalid profile warning, I have a hunch that it is still something related to cryptography/keys and profile signing, but, I just can't find it.  <answer42647> I figured out that reinstalling the profile file into iOS Configuration Utility fixed it for me so probably make copies.  <comment22915> I can't create tags - This is on a Ipod, but it affects everything Idevice... Can someone create a tag for the configuration utility as that is what the error is specifically with? <comment48482> Make copies of what? Could you please expand and clarify your answer?
