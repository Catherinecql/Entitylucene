Copy static cell value in Numbers <body> In numbers I have a table that contains some configuration values, I reference these in formulas but when I copy and paste the cells using the configuration values it breaks as it increments the cell position.  How can I copy and paste the cells but maintain the reference to the configuration value?  Thanks  <answer11600> You need to use the $ char e.g. like this: code=$D$3/code  <answer155350> This works great. You can also simply use this statement: code=$cell,cell#/code This will copy the value of the Cell/cellNumber to the highlighted cell of interest. Changing the value in one, will automatically reflect the changes in the other cell.
