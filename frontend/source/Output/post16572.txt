What are the default permissions on the Applications folder in OS X supposed to be? <body> I was trying to run VirtualBox on OS X when I got the error:  precodeFailed to open a session for the virtual machine tinyXP. Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_SUPLIB_WORLD_WRITABLE). Unknown error creating VM (VERR_SUPLIB_WORLD_WRITABLE). /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cqRBN.png" alt=""  According to this article http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/8410, it is because the permissions on my code/Applications/code folder are too broad. I checked, and I was actually very surprised to learn that the folder was in fact world-readable / world-writable.  precodedrwxrwxrwx+ 164 root  admin      5576 Jun 26 22:27 Applications /code/pre  So before I go changing them, I'm wondering if that is normal or if somehow they got changed?  <answer16573> That is not normal - I have  precodedrwxrwxr-x+ 73 root     admin         2482 24 Jun 09:28 Applications/ /code/pre  There is a option in Disk Utility.app to repair permissions which should change the Applications directory and others back.  <comment18112> +1 for repairing permissions with Disk Utility. I do that once a month as a matter of course. <comment18335> That's great. Hundreds of things out of wack on mine. Thanks!
