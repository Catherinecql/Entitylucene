Does a Wireshark implementation exist for iPhone 4? <body> Does a Wireshark implementation exist for iPhone 4? I recently felt a need to have some tools with me at all times.  <answer7304> If you have a jail broken iPhone you can ssh into it and install tcpdump. Tcpdump is a command line program that wireshark is indirectly built off of.  <answer7320> Unfortunately, there is no official version of Wireshark on iPhone. However, there is one for Macs.  <answer7326> There's no WireShark app for iPhone no but there are a few Network Diagnostics tools which may do what you need since you don't state exactly what you want to do.  Take a look at Network Diagnostics Utility Pro which is $4.99 and might cover your requirements.   <answer7433> pirni is an iOS packet capture tool that does ARP poisoning and can dump to PCAP for analysis in Wireshark on a desktop.  pirni-derv can do some basic analysis on iOS.
