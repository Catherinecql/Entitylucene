Apache works, 127.0.0.1 is accessible, but http://localhost/ is not <body> In 10.7.2 update Apple roll out new bug, - hosts bug. This crashed broken hosts. I had tried install and configure dnsmasq, reconfig /etc/hosts/, and after this manipulations http://localhost/ doesn't load. If you need more info, please request it ))   My /etc/hosts file:  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1 localhost fe80::1%lo0 localhost # /code/pre  My /etc/resolv.conf file:  precode# # Mac OS X Notice # # This file is not used by the host name and address resolution # or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on # this Mac OS X system. # # This file is automatically generated. # domain RT-G32 nameserver 8.8.8.8 /code/pre  dig localhost   ps sorry for a little broken english ^_^  <answer27736> First, how are you trying to edit your hosts file? It's important information, since it's critical upon doing any type of edit that it's done a certain way. Also, if you could explain in more detail the exact issues you seem to be experiencing that would help too.   I'm not understanding how this is different from what you asked yesterday:  How set up a local domain such as local.test?  I'll take a look at your hosts file if you would like, just let me know.  <answer36622> dig localhost should return 127.0.0.1 . Check if the DNS on your machine is running.   precodedig localhost  ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.7.3-P3 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; localhost ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 20521 ;; flags: qr; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;localhost.

Reconfigure apache to listen to the ipv6 loopback or point localhost to 127.0.0.1
