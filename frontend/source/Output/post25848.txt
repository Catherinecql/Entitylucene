Lion drag and drop with trackpad? <body> I have tap to click enabled. Is there a gesture that I can use to drag and drop? (especially in Finder). I do not want to over-ride the new three finger swipe for dektop change.  <answer25852> You could click the button (the hardware trackpad button, thumb works best) to "lock" onto something and then move another finger around to drag around.  <answer25864> In Lion, you can enable traditional trackpad dragging in System Preferences  Universal Access  Mouse &amp; Trackpad (tab)  Trackpad Options (button at bottom). You can also choose whether to use Drag Lock.  This is also where you go for various scrolling options (enable/disable, inertia, speed).
