How can I get my own apps onto my jailbroken iPhone? <body> I want to be able to test the apps I am creating on my jaikbroken iPhone 3Gs, and I want to know how I can get my apps from xCode onto my device without a developer account.  <answer30155> This article really helped me.  I'm not sure if it's still that relevant though. I remember just setting my xCode to "Don't code sign" or something similar. I can't really check it right now, I'll get back to this. Make sure you have appsync installed on your iPhone though, that is a must.  After that you might be able to run the app on the iPhone, but you won't be able to debug it live.
