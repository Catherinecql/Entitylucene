How to prevent TextMate from overwriting symbolic links? <body> In a web project I have multiple environments and a code.htaccess.&lt;env&gt;/code file for each of them. In each of the environments I've made a symbolic link from code.htaccess/code to the right file.  Now, whenever I use TextMate to edit the file through the symlink, the link gets overwritten by a copy of the link's target file. How can I make TextMate to preserve the symlink?  <answer4915> Disable codeAtomic Saves/code in codeAdvanced Preferences/code.  When atomic saves are enabled, TextMate actually writes to a new file on Save and then moves the file over (hence overwriting your symbolic link).  See http://manual.macromates.com/en/saving_files#atomic_saves for more info.
