Titling tabs in Terminal <body> I'd like to be able to set the titles on my tabs to short, easy-to-remember things, since I often have a few open. You can use Command-I and set the Title that way, but OSX appends the name of the currently running process to that title, (e.g. "test title -- bash").  Is there any way to set the full text of the tab title?  This is on OSX 10.6. There used to be a way to do this on 10.5 using SIMBL, but that no longer works.  <answer9873> In Preferences choose the windows tab for your set of settings. There is an option Active process name - if this is not ticked then you should not see the command in the title bar.  <answer9874> You could install xtermcontrol (also via fink, macports, etc.), and then use that to set the title to whatever you want. I have the following codecd/code in my code.bash_profile/code, so that any time I change directories the directory is in the xterm window title:  precodecd() {   if [ -n "$1" ]; then     builtin cd "$@"; xtermcontrol --title "$@"   else     builtin cd ~;  xtermcontrol --title "~"   fi } /code/pre  You can also set up aliases or customize your ssh settings so that hostnames are added to the title when you leave this host, etc.  <answer86470> I turned off, 'show active process' in preferences.  Along with all the other trivia.  I want emdifferent/em trivia.  As an example, I have the following two lines in my code.bash_profile/code in my home directory. (code.bash_profile/code gets executed in every new tab/window)  precodePROMPT_COMMAND='echo -n -e "\033]0;`basename $PWD`\007"' function vi { echo -n -e "\033]0;vi $1\007" ; vim $1 ;} /code/pre  The first command sets the tab to the last directory in my current bath. e.g. if I'm in code~sherwood/foo/bar/code this will be bar  The second one in effect turns vi (my editor of choice) into a pair of commands that does the same sort of echo, but now it sets the tab to show that I'm editing this file.  So if I'm editing code~sherwood/foo/bar/baz/code, it will show codevi baz/code  Note that it will show whatever you told vi.  So if you type  codevi /some/long/path/to/a/../../name/code  that's what the tab will show, or at least as much of it as will fit.  At this time I have not found a way to set the title bar differently from the tab.  <comment110626> Oh, I am not very good at bash. Can you, please, tell how to title current tab with current directory where I stay?
