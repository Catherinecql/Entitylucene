OSX: Affix window to not move on spaces switch <body> Is there an option, or external program that anyone knows of that would allow me to set window to always stay in the same position on every one of my 4 spaces / not move when I switch.   Like I want VLC player to not move so I watch a movie, but switch spaces between other applications.  <answer17482> Open System Preferences  Exposé &amp; Spaces, click the "+" under the listbox of Application Space assignments, select your application (which must be running), then click in the strongSpace/strong column for the newly-added application entry where it says "Space 1"; "Every Space" appears at the top of the dropdown list.
