Is there an iPad PDF Reader app that has autoscroll? <body> I read stacks of PDFs on my iPad and I have downloaded (and paid for) a few PDF readers hoping to find an auto-scroll feature, without luck.  Does anyone know of any iPad app that can auto-scroll PDF's (preferably with Dropbox integration so I can get at my PDFs easily!).  Thanks  <answer10461> I think GoodReader (iTunes Link) is right up your alley.  It supports PDFs primarily, but according to it's site also supports Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, HTML WebArchive, images/audio/video files.  It can connect to Dropbox shares, download resources directly off the web (and some other protocols, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV) in-app, supports Document Sharing (file loading via iTunes), features autoscroll, and many many more features and customizations that you didn't ask about!  It is unfortunately NOT a Universal app, USD$5 for the iPad version. And another USD$5 should you ever want to buy it for an iPhone/iPod.  <answer10495> If good reader has PDF autoscroll I haven't found it. What it CAN do is extract text from a PDF, display it as if it were plain text, and autoscroll that.  <answer13591> To date, I have found only one PDF reader that has Dropbox connectivity and has autoscroll(after a fashion.)  It is PDF Reader Pro iTunes Link. It is a universal app that works on both iPad and iPhone and ties to Box.net, Dropbox, Googledocs, and iDisk.  It has an "Autoflow" feature that allows timed jumps (from 5 to 100 seconds) of a preset number of pixels (20 to 400.)  I bought it at the low price of $0.99 and it performs, pretty much, as expected.  It has some basic annotation capabilities and "scans" documents using the camera in the iPad 2.  I have an original so I couldn't test that feature.  I haven't used it a lot as I like the annotative capabilities of iAnnotate, but the app is a good fall back if I need the autoflow feature.  For $0.99 it looks to be a solid reader that fits the requirements you laid out.  <answer130977> Try Filemagnet!  You can control autoscroll with the tilt of your device.  <comment10989> Tried GoodReader, unfortunately it only autoscrolls for .txt files and not PDFs :-( <comment11014> Did you down vote me for that? :( <comment11103> Nope I didn't... <comment11115> I did read a workaround regarding PDFs and GoodReader. I believe it was something about using the "PDF Reflow" feature, which turns it into text, which can be autoscrolled. Worthless if you're reading a PDF with significant style or photos, but worth a try otherwise! <comment11337> Tried that aswell - as far as I can see it only seems to scroll to the end of the current page and doesn't continue to the next page...unless I am doing something wrong. <comment11458> I'm afraid I can't really provide any more insight. Sorry. I don't use GoodReader for this aspect. <comment11633> Recommend the feature to developers. <comment14510> Great thanks Andy. Sounds like what I need, I will check it out.
