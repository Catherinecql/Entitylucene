How to get a device back in Parallels? <body> I'm using Windows 7 with Parallels Desktop.   When I open an instance of Windows 7, I see the 'Device' menu. I can choose which OS (Windows or OS X) can own a device within the menu.  The problem is, When I let Windows own my mouse, there's no way to get it back to Mac OS. The only way I found so far is to open a terminal then kill the instance of Parallels.  How do I get a device back within Parallels?  <answer60873> In early versions of Parallels, you can get the mouse back by shutting down the VM. You could also connect a second mouse and leave that controlled by OS X - in effect you'd have a "Mac mouse" and a "Windows mouse".  For other devices, suspending the VM should give control back to OS X. (If you want to do this with the mouse, I suggest either the two-mouse setup or learning VoiceOver so you can do mouse-only things with the keyboard.)  <answer60874> Is SmartMouse enabled for your Virtual Machine? If not, clicking inside the Parallels window will capture the mouse and you will need to use Ctrl+Option (Ctrl+Alt) to release it back to your Mac.  <comment70026> I don't see that this is an off-topic question, as it relates to OS X software. <comment70117> There is a valid question hidden here (how do I reassign external devices between OS X and a Parallels VM) but the specific problem with the mouse is rather strange (because Parallels handles the mouse differently). Seems to be rather localized.
