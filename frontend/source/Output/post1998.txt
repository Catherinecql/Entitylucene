Recommendations for iPhone Bluetooth Headsets for Listening to Music? <body> I have a Motorola ROKR S9-HD headset and the Previous and Next buttons don't work with my iPhone 4.  I'm thinking about buying a different headset to replace it.  What options exist and which are the best?  Does the previous and next function work on any of them, or is this an iPhone problem?  <answer3053> I'm pretty happy with the Nokia BH-214 for my iPhone 3G. It's relatively cheap, and it turns any headset into a bluetooth headset.
