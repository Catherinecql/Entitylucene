Address Book: Is there any way to move the fields up/down? <body> Is there any way to move the fields within Address Book up or down? I like to have order on my address book and it looks really bad when the phone number fields are all over the place.   <answer15280> I'm afraid you cannot change the order they appear in, you can only change what fields are shown in the Template Section of the Preferences.
