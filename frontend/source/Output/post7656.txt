I'm not really experiencing any unreasonable sluggishness, but I am starting to pile up on the extensions and was considering pruning the most performance draining ones just for good measure.  <answer7665> Disable the extension.  Run Safari for an hour (normal use) and note the kind of cpu/memory usages you get from it (using activity monitor or top).  Enable the extension.  Repeat.  <answer7670> You can also use Instruments and attach it to your safari instance and start from there.
