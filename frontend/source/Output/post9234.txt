MacBook freezing? <body> While I was working with my (unibody, 10.5) MacBook, suddenly the display was covered by a grey shade and a message - in four languages - appeared, ordering me to restart the computer, and of course nothing else was working.br While I know that I should describe in detail all programs running etc., does anybody have an idea about what kind of problem could possibly have caused this? I don't believe it ever happened in almost three years with the same computer.  <answer9235> This is called a Kernel Panic, and it probably wasn't your fault. They usually aren't a huge deal.  This Apple doc has information about what happened, and directions about what could have caused it and how to fix it.  In says about the problem:     This message indicates that an error   occurred in the core of the operating   system, which is referred to as a   “kernel panic.”      A kernel panic can be caused by   damaged or incompatible software or,   in rare cases, by damaged or   incompatible hardware. The most likely   cause of the problem is that a system   file or folder has been moved,   replaced, or damaged.   See the To Solve This Problem section for directions about recovery.  <comment9780> Great, this seems to be exactly what happened to me. I had deleted some "Application support" files for programs I had deleted. I hope I deleted one file too many. Thanks!
