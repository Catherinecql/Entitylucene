Why do I get a plain blue screen when I connect my Mac Mini to an external monitor? <body> I have one of the new mac mini's and run multiple users on it.  At any time up to 5 users may be logged in.  I have a keyboard and monitor that I connect to alot of machines so very often the mini has no monitor plugged in.  When I connect my monitor - Dell Monitor, VGA to HDMI adapter that came with mini - I get just a plain blue screen.  It looks like the blue that you see when the mac is switching users.    I've turned off all the energy saver options thinking that it might be going to sleep and not awaking.  Any other ideas as to what might be causing this and how I can prevent it?  Every time I connect my monitor I need to reboot to use the mini.  Update:  I've tried a couple of more things - I turned off the screen saver also, I tried connecting to the machine using LogMeIn (http://logmein.com) all with similar results.  It's as if when a monitor is not attached the mac stops outputting display.  It is still running, I just can't get the display to work.  Update - this what I get when I SSH in and do a top command:  precodeMacintosh-5:~ litmus$ top Processes: 134 total, 2 running, 132 sleeping, 590 threads             10:39:24 Load Avg: 0.48, 0.46, 0.24  CPU usage: 1.87% user, 4.22% sys, 93.89% idle SharedLibs: 4872K resident, 11M data, 0B linkedit.

The issue had to do with the fact that I am using multiple users and emFast User Switching/em.  You can read more details about it in this thread:  http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2177922&amp;start=15&amp;tstart=0  The gist is that each user has it's own loginwindow process running.  These multiple loginwindow process' reek havoc with any method of remote controlling the mac -VNC, Apple Remote Desktop, LogMeIn even unplugging/plugging in a monitor is affected.    So you need to kill all loginwindow processes before connecting.  To do this:    ol liConnect via ssh/li liissue a codeps auxwww|grep loginwindow/code to find the current loginwindow processes that are running - there will be one for each user + one for console/li lifor each process call codesudo kill -9 pid/code where pid is the process id/li /ol  * note:  you do not need to kill the loginwindow for console  Much thanks to Martin Marconcini who led me down the path of investigating the running processes via SSH.  <comment3974> Interesting issue (but sad), have you tried accessing through ssh and seeing the list of processes? Have you tried another monitor (just in case this one is failing to initialize). Do you have a way to avoid the VGA-HDMI adapter? (for the sake of testing). Those are the things that come out of my mind without much further analysis. <comment4091> Updated with results of my ssh'in...any ideas? <comment4106> there doesn’t seem to be anything out of the ordinary… does this happen if you start in “Safe mode”? <comment4113> @Martin - Figured it out, posted answer - thanks for the help! <comment4115> Glad to know you fixed it!!
