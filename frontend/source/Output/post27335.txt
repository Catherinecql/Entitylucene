Problem with two-finger swipes on my magic mouse. Is there any form of fix? <body> Recently, I've migrated from a strict Windows to a OSX environment.  I'm using the Magic Mouse as my pointing device and so far I've been satisfied.  The only problem that I am having is that I can not get my mouse to consistently recognize my two-finger swipes to swap between my full screen apps.  It does work but only occasionally.  Specifically, I have to swipe about 30 times before the screen will actually switch to the other application.  Also, I know that the mouse is partially picking up my gesture because the window will begin to barely transition, but I usually can't get the screen to shift any more than a couple inches on my 27" display.   This is unusable.  Are there any gesture sensitivity settings that I may be able to tweak, buried in some form of an initialization of configuration file?  Or, am I stuck and I'll have to simply avoid using this gesture?  I think this functionality would be very useful.  For now, however, it's not an option.  <answer27347> Try this little utility: http://www.magicprefs.com/  It allows you to override mouse gestures, map them to your own actions, etc. It also has a graphical view to show you what you're doing, which can be very useful in figuring out what you're doing wrong.  <answer27353> I'd also suggests BetterTouchTool, a fork of Multiclutch, which allows you to remap a tons of multi-touch gestures.  Moreover the program allows for windows snapping (a là Windows 7), and keyboard shortcuts.  It's definitely worth a try.  <comment31542> Wow, this has helped tremendously.  BetterTouchTool contains a screen that allows the user to visualize there touches on the Magic Mouse.  When I opened it, I quickly saw my problem with the two-finger swipe-- my skinny little fingers were registering as one big finger!  Thanks Gio
