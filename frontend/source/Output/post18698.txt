Spaces: visualization in menubar, and arbitrary keybinding for 'goto next space' <body> I'm looking for a tool or tools to  (1) switch to the next (or previous) space using an arbitrary keybinding, rathern than the modifier+arrow keys allowed in the preferences, and (2) show a (very) small preview of the windows in Spaces in the menubar.  I've been using Desktop Manager to do this since before they were called spaces.  Unfortunately Desktop Manager is PowerPC-only and is not being maintained; I'd like a more modern solution.  I'm much more interested in solving the first problem; specifically I'd like to have ctrl-command-n to move me to the next space, and ctrl-command-p to go to the previous space.    Any quick solutions?  <answer18699> You can set a shortcut via Keyboard Shortcuts. Remember to tick the checkbox too!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JqCJs.jpg" alt="Move Spaces shortcuts"  <comment20456> Thanks, that was simple!  Now that I see a solution available in Lion, I'll upgrade.
