No bootable device USB 2.0 MacBook Pro mid 2014 <body> I've been tearing my hair out the last couple days trying to get Windows installed.  I have a MacBook Pro Retina 15 inch mid 2014. Yosemite version 10.10.1. Win 7 64 bit iso (sha1 - 0bcfc54019ea175b1ee51f6d2b207a3d14dd2b58).  I have tried two usb 2.0 flash drives with 'Create a Windows 7 or later install disk' option in BCA. This proceeds smoothly and so does creating the partition using Install Windows 7 option.  However, when it restarts, it says something along the lines of 'no bootable device'  If I hold down 'alt', the only options are to boot back into OS X &amp; the recovery disk.  I realise this question has been asked countless times - I have read a lot of them but few seem applicable to my situation and those that are have not helped yet. I have not tried another USB yet since I am bandwidth limited (both in download speed and data limit) and BCA wants to redownload Windows support files every time and at this point it feels like a shot in the dark.  Any help with this will be greatly appreciated.  Some further questions:  ul liIs there a way to determine whether the usb drives are at fault?/li liDoes BCA create the bootable drive in any special way? I.e. is it possible to create it by another method that will still play well with the bootcamp process?/li /ul  <answer225404> I do not have a new enough Mac to install using a USB flash drive and I have not created one recently enough to remember what is stored on it. You can mount the iso file and I believe you should be able to compare with the content on the flash drive. But again I am not sure.  Your external USB ports are both USB 3 and that might just be the problem. The Windows 7 installer may not work with USB 3 ports. Do you suppose Apple expects you to use an external optical (DVD) drive?  It is possible to install Windows 7 without the use of a USB flash drive or a optical DVD drive. The process is tedious and I will not go into the steps unless you are interested. You will need to download free third party software to do so.  Did you download the "Boot Camp Support Software" and follow the steps outlined at the site given below?  Install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp  <answer225521> h2Installing Windows 7 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive/h2     Special thanks to user Rafa, who was able to correct this procedure so it now works with Windows 10.   Here I assume your computer is configured as required by the Boot Camp Assistant. (In other words, you will be installing Windows to the 4th partition on disk 0.) Also, your firmware is up to date and you have downloaded the correct "Boot Camp Support Software" for your model Mac computer. strongBefore starting, remove all DVD's and external devices from your Mac./strong      Note: Some of the steps, emthat do not involve VirtualBox/em, have images captured from a VirtualBox window. This was done when this was the easiest way to create an illustration. I suppose I could have cropped the images, but I chose not to.   (Hint: For a better view, click on an image or open an image in a new window.)  ol liCreate a MS-DOS (FAT) formatted partition on your Macs internal drive. This is where Windows 7 will be installed. You can use the Bootcamp Assistant, the Disk Utility, or commands (codedistutil/code, codegpt/code and/or codefdisk/code) entered in a Terminal window. Other third party tools, such as codegdisk/code, can also be used. Give the label for this partition the name "BOOTCAMP". When finished, quit all applications.     This procedure requires the "BOOTCAMP" partition be the 4th partition on your Macs internal drive (disk0). If you are using the   Disk Utility from OS X 10.7 or newer and your Mac has the default   drive configuration, then the new "BOOTCAMP" partition should be   created as the 4th partition automatically. /li liDownload and install a free copy of VirtualBox. I used VirtualBox 5.0.14 r105127, Copyright © 2016./li liDo the following to transfer the "Boot Camp Support Software" to a partition compatible with VirtualBox. Create folder named "VirtualBox" in your Documents folder. Open the Disk Utility and from the menu bar select strongFile-New-Blank Disk Image/strong. Create this image in the "VirtualBox" folder using the following parameters.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Epn3.png" alt="1"  Using the Finder application, copy the "Boot Camp Support Software" to this new partition. When finish, this new partition should appear in the Finder as shown below. (For readers with older Macs, you may only have the "BootCamp" folder.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mZw4Q.png" alt="2"/li liThis step will create the file needed by VirtualBox to access the partition containing the "Boot Camp Support Software". In a Terminal application window, enter the following commands.     Note: I assume you are using the default Bourne-Again Shell (bash).    precodecd  ~/documents/virtualbox open  bcss.dmg DISK1=$(mount|awk  -F  s1  '/BCSS/{print$1}') diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1 vboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  "$PWD/bcss.vmdk"  -rawdisk  $DISK1 /code/pre  The result should be the creation of the file codebcss.vmdk/code in your "VirtualBox" folder. Later, you will select this file to give a virtual machine access to this partition.     Note: At this point, one should realize it would be easier to copy the commands from this document and paste them into the Terminal   application window. /li liThis step will create the files needed by VirtualBox to access the physical partition where you will install Windows. In a Terminal application window, enter the following commands.  precodecd  ~/documents/virtualbox DISK0=/dev/disk0 PARTITION=4 PARTID="$DISK0"s"$PARTITION" diskutil  unmount  $PARTID  sudo  chmod  go+rw  $PARTID sudo  vboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  "$PWD/bootcamp.vmdk"  -rawdisk  $DISK0  -partitions  $PARTITION sudo  chown  $USER  bootcamp*.vmdk /code/pre     Note: This access granted by the codechmod/code command will only last   until OS X is rebooted.   The result should be the creation of the files codebootcamp.vmdk/code and codebootcamp-pt.vmdk/code in your "VirtualBox" folder. Later, you will select the file codebootcamp.vmdk/code to give a virtual machine access to the physical partition.     Note: OS X prefers to automount file systems. This can be disabled for a particular partition by creating or modifying the code/etc/fstab/code   file. Instead of employing the code/etc/fstab/code file, the user is asked   to repeatedly enter the following commands.  precodediskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1 /code/pre      These commands unmount the physical "BOOTCAMP" partition and the disk image file codebcss.dmg/code containing the "BCSS" partition. /li liConfigure the virtual machine. Open the VirtualBox application and click on icon above the New label. Enter or select the values shown below, then click the "Continue" button.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n0rad.png" alt="2000"  Use the default settings except for the hard drive. Choose the "Use an existing virtual hard drive file" button. Navigate to your "VirtualBox" folder. Highlight the codebootcamp.vmdk/code file. Before clicking the "Open" button, enter the following commands in the same Terminal application window.  precodediskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1 /code/pre  Open the codebootcamp.vmdk/code file. Your window should appear similar to what is shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8AA2b.png" alt="2001"  Click the "Create" button.  After returning to the VirtualBox application's "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager" window and click on the icon above the "Settings" label. Next, click on the icon above the "Storage" label. In the "Storage Tree", "Controller: SATA" should be highlighted. Right click on this highlighted area and select "Add Hard Disk". Choose the "Use an existing virtual hard drive file" button. Navigate to your "VirtualBox" folder. Highlight the codebcss.vmdk/code file. Before clicking the "Open" button, enter the following commands in the same Terminal application window.  precodediskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1 /code/pre  Open the codebcss.vmdk/code file. strongNext, select the "Use Host I/O Cache" option./strong Your window should appear similar to what is shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkina.png" alt="2002"  Highlight the Empty CD/DVD and select "Choose Virtual Optical Disk File..." to attach your Windows 7 iso file. (Hint: Look for the CD/DVD icons)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LpMB9.png" alt="2003"  Click OK to close the window. Your "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager" window should appear similar to what is shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKj6f.png" alt="2004"/li liIn this step, you will copy the necessary files to the physical partition, so later you can restart your Mac and install Windows. Enter the following commands in the same Terminal application window.  precodediskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1 /code/pre  Next, click on the icon above the "Start" label to boot from the Windows 7 iso file. Press the space bar, if prompted to "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD."     Note: The mouse pointer must be over the virtual machine screen window before you press the space bar.   When the display below appears, click the "Next" button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ow4o4.png" alt="100"  When the display below appears, select "Repair your computer".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvQom.png" alt="101"  With the button "Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows." selected, click the Next button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CeBuQ.png" alt="102"  Select the "Command Prompt" option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jl5Kd.png" alt="103"  Insure the drive letters codeC/code through codeF/code are not assigned by default to a volume by entering the following commands.   precodemountvol  c:  /d  &gt;nul mountvol  d:  /d  &gt;nul mountvol  e:  /d  &gt;nul mountvol  f:  /d  &gt;nul /code/pre  Enter the following to determine a list of the current volumes.  precodediskpart list  volume /code/pre  The image below displays the volumes found on my Mac. You may get different results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1UdC2.png" alt="9000"  Enter the following commands, to assign the drive letters codeD/code, codeC/code and codeE/code to the CD-ROM volume and the volumes labeled "BOOTCAMP" and "BCSS", respectively. In the image shown above, these are volumes 0, 3 and 4. If your volume indices are different, make the appropriate substitutions. Also, NTFS format the "BOOTCAMP" volume.  precodeselect  volume  3 assign  letter=c format  quick  fs=ntfs  label=BOOTCAMP select  volume  0 assign  letter=d select  volume  4 assign  letter=e list  volume exit /code/pre  When finished, the volume letters should appear similar to what is shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJu00.png" alt="9001"  Next, enter the commands givens below. The codebootsect/code command writes boot code to a Volume Boot Record (VBR) of a partition and Master Boot Record (MBR) of the corresponding drive.  precodebootsect  /nt60  c:  /mbr bootsect  /nt60  e:  /mbr /code/pre  The next sequence of commands creates a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file. The VHD represents a virtual flash drive from which Windows will be installed on to the physical "BOOTCAMP" partition.     Note: If you are installing Windows 10, then the parameter codefs=fat32/code, in the codeformat/code command shown below, should be replaced   with codefs=ntfs/code.   precodediskpart create  vdisk  file=c:\flashdrive.vhd  maximum=8000  type=fixed  attach  vdisk create  partition  primary format  quick  fs=fat32  label=FLASHDRIVE assign  letter=f exit /code/pre  Finally, copy the Windows installer iso and "Boot Camp Support Software" files first to VHD, then directly to the physical partition where Windows is to be installed. Exit the Command Prompt window when finished.  precodexcopy  d:*  f:  /s  /h xcopy  e:*  f:  /s  /y xcopy  f:*  c:  /s  /h exit /code/pre     Note: The files code\sources\boot.wim/code and code\sources\install.wim/code take a long time to copy. The file sizes are 168 MB and 2.95 GB,   respectively.   Select the "Shut Down" button to shutdown the virtual machine. Quit the VirtualBox application./li liThis step will involve configuring Master Boot Record (MBR) of your physical internal drive. The MBR is stored on the first 512 bytes of this drive. This space is shared by boot code and the MBR partition table.      strongThis step can not be preformed under OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) with System Integrity Protection (SIP) turn on./strong (This is the default   setting.) If you are using OS X 10.11, you must disable SIP,   complete this step, then restore SIP. See the link: How do I   disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X   10.11, El Capitan?.   In a Terminal application window, enter the following commands. The first codefdisk/code command flags the "BOOTCAMP" partition as the active partition. The second codefdisk/code command changes the "BOOTCAMP" partition id to 7. The final codefdisk/code command copies the boot code from the MBR of the disk containing the "Boot Camp Support Software" partition to the MBR of the physical disk containing the "BOOTCAMP" partition.  precodecd  ~/documents/virtualbox DISK0=/dev/disk0 PARTITION=4 PARTID="$DISK0"s"$PARTITION" open  bcss.dmg DISK1=$(mount|awk  -F  s1  '/BCSS/{print$1}') INPUT=$(printf  "f  $PARTITION\nq\ny") sudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  &lt;&lt;&lt;"$INPUT"  &amp;&gt;/dev/null INPUT=$(printf  "s  $PARTITION\n7\nq\ny") sudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  &lt;&lt;&lt;"$INPUT"  &amp;&gt;/dev/null sudo  fdisk  -u  -y  -f  $DISK1  $DISK0 diskutil  mount  $PARTID /code/pre     Note: To display the value for the variable INPUT, use the command codeecho "$INPUT"/code. /li liThis is the step where you install Windows to your "BOOTCAMP" partition. Restart your Mac and hold down the kbdoption/alt/kbd key. Select the Windows icon to boot from the "BOOTCAMP" partition. Open a Command Prompt window, by navigating through the displays as you did in step 7. Enter the commands below to attach the "FLASHDRIVE" partition stored in the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file.   precodediskpart select  vdisk  file=c:\flashdrive.vhd attach  vdisk  readonly list  volume exit /code/pre  On my Mac, the output from the codelist volume/code command shows codeE/code to be the drive letter assigned to the "FLASHDRIVE" partition. If your drive letter is different, make the correct substitution when entering the codee:\setup/code command given at the end of this step. Next, remove all the files, but one, from the "BOOTCAMP" partition.  precodermdir  /s  /q  c:\ /code/pre     If the above command executes correctly, you should get the error message: "c:\flashdrive.vhd - The process cannot access the file   because it is being used by another process."   Start installing Windows 7 by entering the command given below. Select "BOOTCAMP" as your installation partition.  precodee:\setup /code/pre  The installation files are stored in the "FLASHDRIVE" partition. Since this partition is stored as a VHD file in the "BOOTCAMP" partition, do not try to reformat the "BOOTCAMP" partition. You will remove these installation files in a later step. When your Mac restarts, it will boot to OS X. This is to be expected. From the "System Preferences" select Windows as your startup disk and restart the Mac. Your Windows installation will continue./li liOnce Windows finishes installing, the "Boot Camp Support Software"  can be applied. To access this software, the codec:\flashdrive.vhd/code  file, containing the "FLASHDRIVE" partition, needs to be attached.  Click on the "Start" button, type in codediskmgmt.msc/code and hit the  kbdreturn/kbd key. Once in Disk Management, click on strongAction/strong  in the menu bar and select strongAttach VHD/strong. Select the file location  and check "Read-only" to prevent writes to the VHD  file. After you  hit "OK", the drive will show up in Disk  Management with a blue  icon. Close Disk Management.  In the AutoPlay popup window, select "Open folder to view files."  (If no popup appears, use the Windows Explorer to open the drive  labeled "FLASHDRIVE".) The codesetup.exe/code file can be found in the  folder labeled  "BootCamp". Execute this application to install the  "Boot Camp Support Software". The VHD file will detach when the  computer restarts./li liFinally, remove DVD and "Boot Camp Support Software" folders and   files.  This can be accomplished by dragging the   codec:\flashdrive.vhd/code file to the Recycle Bin. If you get an error   message about the file being open, restart the computer and try   again./li /ol  h2Clean Up/h2  The "Virtual Box" folder can be deleted. You will probably need to eject the "BCSS" partition first.  You can delete the "BootCamp" virtual machine. This can be done from the VirtualBox application. If VirtualBox does not remove all the files, you can remove them manually. Look in the code~/"VirtualBox VMs"/code folder.  You can delete the Windows 7 iso file.  You can remove the VirtualBox application, but since it takes such little space, I would not bother.  <answer226943> It so happened that I did a win10 install on my MacBook Air just yesterday, and I ran into exactly the same problem of seeing "no bootable partition", followed by having only two choices at the boot selection screen after power cycle. However, I didn't do anything special to get it working. I just restarted it again, while holding down the Option key from the beginning, and the USB (windows) showed up as one of the boot choices. I'll just list everything I can think of so that you might spot something:  ul liMacBook Air (mid 2012). Latest El Capitan 10.11.3. USB 2 flash drive (not USB 3).  ol liDownload win10 64 bit installation ISO file from MS./li liUse BCA to create bootable installation drive on the flash drive, and download the boot camp files to the same drive. Create bootcamp partition (70GB)/li liRemove a JetDrive that I had in the SD card slot. No other external drive except the USB flash drive/li liRestart.

Hold the Option key when it starts to power up./li liNow it shows 4 choices on the boot screen: Macintosh HD, Recovery, USB (Windows), USB (EFI boot)./li liChoose USB (Windows). Installation starts./li /ol/li /ul  <comment273516> I hope they dont expect me to use an external optical drive.  The method you refer to, is that making use of eg virtual box?  I've so far stuck with bootcamp as I *really* want to avoid messing up my drive (this has happened to me so many times on windows). <comment273517> I did not download the software separately no, it happens as part of the process in BCA to make a bootable usb.  I followed all of the other steps though <comment273580> I purpose of downloading the _**Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5640**_ was to save on your limited bandwidth. The files use 1.36 GB of space and once this step in completed you should not have to repeat it. You are correct, the third party software is VirtualBox. The installer for VirtualBox is a 91 MB file, so it should download fairly quickly. One advantage to having VirtualBox installed, is you could then boot from the Window 7 iso using a virtual machine to see if the iso is any good.  You could then copy these files to your Boot Camp partition and install windows on your physical Mac. <comment273586> Unfortunately if I test a new usb I have no choice regarding the download of the windows support software - the box cannot be unchecked.  Have you used the virtualbox method before? Are you aware of any dangers in using that method? I do already have virtualbox installed. <comment273590> Yes, I have used VirtualBox to install Windows to physical partition on my 2007 iMac. If you wish, I could post a tutorial where you would employ the procedure to install Windows on a virtual machine. You could then try the procedure for yourself. This should be fairly safe, since you would be only working in a virtual environment. Later, I could post how to do the same, using the physical BOOTCAMP partition on your Mac. Here, VirtualBox would only be used to copy the files to the physical partition. You would not use VirtualBox to do the physical install of Windows to the BOOTCAMP partition. <comment273607> Thanks, I do know how to install to a virtual machine but this doesn't help me much as I require access to the gfx card. Instructions for installing to bootcamp partition would be welcome <comment273613> OK, then I should assume you have a fairly good understand of how to use the Windows commands `DISKPART`, `XCOPY`, `BOOTSECT` and `BOOTREC`? <comment273621> You will need to first create a physical partition to hold the Windows 7 operating system. If the BCA already created this partition you can use that one. Otherwise, use the Disk Utility or other utility to create this partition. The partition should be FAT formatted with the label BOOTCAMP. Afterwards, enter the following commands in a Terminal window and post the output to your question: `diskutil  list`, `sudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0` and `sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0`. None of these commands will change your computer. Some may ask for your login password. This is normal. <comment275774> Dear David, your tutorial is a **materpiece**. I take a while to have success in the process, but now I am typing from Windows 10 in my iMac 2009. - I made some changes (like my disk is disk1s3 because I use SSD + HDD) and I used Windows' UI ('Explorer' from the Installer) to copy BCSS and Windows files to the FLASHDRIVE, because in cmd I was getting errors, Anyway, thanks for your help, really usefull and detailed! <comment275775> Oh, and suggestions: use quotation marks on ```$PWD/bcss.vmdk```, because new users can have space in their disk name (like "Mac HD"). And in ```create  paritition  primary``` the right is ```partition```. <comment275797> @Hugo: Thanks for the corrections. I updated my answer. <comment275798> @Hugo: How did you launch the Windows UI (Explorer) from the installer? <comment275801> I am very interested in your success installing Windows 10. Your model is one of the *officially* supported models for Windows 10. In step 9 you chose a BIOS/MBR (i.e. Window) install over the EFI/GPT (i.e. EFI boot) install. I assume had no problems installing and were able to run "setup.exe" to install the "Boot Camp Support Software" afterwards? If you succeeded, this would confirm Windows 10 is still being installed using the legacy BIOS/MBR method on Macs that officially support Windows 10. <comment275803> Windows 10 shows "advanced options" and "Microsoft tools to try resolving" (something like that) when selected 'Repair computer' instead of Intall. First I used CMD (on advanced options)  to format FLASHDRIVE, assign letter=s, etc. after I came back for Microsoft Tools (where Explorer is), so manually copied everything to FLASHDRIVE. <comment275831> Yes, I selected the "Windows" option instead of the "EFI boot" option. So far, win10 is working fine in BootCamp. I was able to reinstall some of my old windows programs and run them without problems. <comment275836> Remembered a couple more things. First is that I needed to disconnect/remove all external drives including what's in the SD card slot (step 3 above), or the windows installation refuses to use the bootcamp partition. The second is that after windows finished installing, the BCA support software started to install on its own, and eventually got stuck installing Realtek audio (?). Following some advice I found on the web, I just killed the realteksetup.exe task, and BCA can finish installing the rest. So far, everything seems to work fine (track pad, USB, SD card, wifi). <comment275915> What's the point in setting environment variables you only use once or twice? <comment275922> @Max: The genesis of this answer is [Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179486/boot-camp-install-of-windows-7-issue-no-bootable-devices/180263#180263), where the use of environment variable made more sense. This reincarnation assumes a Mac has only one internal drive. Based on [user Hugo's success](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/226262/boot-camp-flash-drive-not-showing-on-boot-for-late-2009-imac), the next generation of this procedure should work for Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 with Macs containing 1 or 2 internal drives. <comment275943> @Max: Originally, I set variable `DISK1` to `/dev/disk1`, but user klanomoath pointed out this would be wrong if Core Storage is being used. User Hugo needed to change `DISK0` to `/dev/disk1` and `PARTITION` to `3`. So the use of variables makes substitutions easier.. Also, once the variables are set, one can cut and paste the commands rather than typing them in. <comment298934> Just to let others know that I followed this procedure and successfully installed Windows 10 alongside OS X 10.11 in my late 2011 MBP 17'. The copy errors that @hugo mentioned are due to the fact that on Windows 10 some setup files are larger than 4G and the Virtual Hard Disk is FAT32, which cannot accommodate them, so the first `xcopy` instruction fails. If you format the VHD with NTFS everything works. <comment298953> @Rafa: Your correction has been entered in the procedure. <comment300556> Can you use Bootcamp to partition instead of Disk Utility? <comment300575> @ Razgriz: Yes, you can use the Boot Camp Assistant application. <comment300589> I just finished installing Win7 in my Macbook Pro using your guide and it works very well. Maybe it's worth noting in your steps that you can use Bootcamp if you prefer that over Disk Utility. DU took a long while partitioning my hard drive that I had to bail out on it, luckily, I was still able to repartition and didn't have to deal with a "phantom missing space". Also, in step 7, at "list volume", I only saw the CD, BootCamp, and BCSS but everything still worked as intended. <comment300590> Also, it may not be as "straightforward" for other people, but if you encounter the Windows 8 Recovery instead of the Windows 7 one, just go to "Advanced", then "Command Prompt". I forgot to take screen caps. <comment300907> I've completed steps 1-8, but the windows partition doesn't show up during the option boot in step 9. Running OSX 10.11.5, on a 15 inch early-2011 macbook pro. Any ideas? <comment301181> @Sir: Which version of windows are you installing? Are you sure you are installing to partition 4 on disk 0? You could post a new question and we could try to diagnose what went wrong. The procedure, if implemented correctly, should work for your model Mac. <comment332660> Thank you so much! The crazy genius David. I've managed to install windows7 ultimate on my iMac 27" ,Mid 2010 in the third try. I am using Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan. My first two attemptions both failed at the step to open command line tool, as I encountered an error when click "Reparing this computer" , I guess the happens because the wrong windows ISO I downloaded.
