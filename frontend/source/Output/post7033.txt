iPhone 3g (iOS 3.1) screen rotation problem <body> One evening, the screen of my iPhone 3g would no longer rotate. It was working fine that morning.  I haven't updated or installed any applications.  <answer7045> The process in charge of reading the accelerometer may be having troubles. I suggest you hold on your power/suspend button for 5 secs and then completely turn off your iPhone. After the phone has been turned off, press the power button again to start it (this will perform a "cold boot" of the phone). That's the equivalent of completely powering off a computer.   If the problem persists after the reboot, then you might have to restore your phone from a backup using iTunes.
