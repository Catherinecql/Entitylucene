Set Bitcoin.app to mount image before opening itself <body> I have all the BitCoin data encrypted on an image on Dropbox. Is it possible to have a script that mounts the data right before I open the BitCoin.app ?  <answer16192> No script needed. Store the app in the DMG. Keep the app (alias) in the Dock. Launching the app via the Dock will mount the DMG.  <comment17693> Ah smart, I didn't think of that.
