iPod Touch, HD video app Dim Screen? <body> Is there an app that will record HD video but sleep or dim the screen? The camera app that comes with the device chews through battery power like crazy.   <answer39320> You can use backgrounder iPhone tweak if jailbroken that will run apps in background While iPhone seems to be shut down I use this when downloading long files I just turn on backgrounder to have app run in background  and press button on top of iPhone so everthing is off but what your running in background
