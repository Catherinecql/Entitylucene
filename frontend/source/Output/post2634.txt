Adding on my command to services menu or adding keyboard shortcuts <body> OnMyCommand allows commands to be added to the shortcut menu. Unfortunately, I can't add them to the services menu or add a keyboard shortcut for them. Is this possible?  <answer2649> Use Apple's automator and save the result as a service. If you select the right conext for the service it will appear in the right click menu. You can add shortcuts to services using System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard shortcuts. Click somewhere to the right of the service name (near the right edge of the white box). A field appears and you can type a shortcut. This is not very intuitive.  <comment2363> Thanks, but I am trying to get it to work with commands from "On my command" rather than having to create new commands in automator <comment2392> Automator does everything you want, including shell script, applescript, shortcuts, services and contextual menu. Why use OMC?
