How can I keep track of source code changes with git and box.net? <body> I have a school project where I have to make a program(java), therefore I need some way to keep track of the changes I make to the sources; I decided the best way to do this it to create a git repository on my box.net account. How is this done?  <answer29697> Go with Git. If you want a GUI client take a look at Gitbox (paid) or Github for Mac (free)  <answer29698> The best version control system I have tried is GIT together with GitHub.  If you are just a single developer that works on a project then SVN is okayish. However when you start collaborating with other developers or work on multiple computers, then a distributed version control system really shines.  A really good app for working with GIT is SourceTree (free).  <comment34306> I used dropbox instead of GitHUB since I already had all my files there and I'm the only that will be working n this project.
