Typing in 2 different applications at the same time <body> I am typing code on Google Docs through Chrome. What I want is for an app to enter whatever I type in the Google Docs into an open XCode editor. This way while I am done typing code I can check for errors. The hard way is to finish coding and select everything and then copy and paste. In short: I am looking for an app that helps you type in 2 different applications at the same time.  <answer27155> As far as I know no, mostly due to the way the OS X window manager is setup you need to have the text area to have focus to receive key input (but not all key events).   However, this is not to say it's emnot/em possible, but I can't think of a way to do it 'live', as in sending the text char by char. If I was looking at doing it basically what I'd be trying to to basically keylog myself (list of keyloggers), and hack a script to switch to Chrome, dump the text and switch back to Xcode, but that's about as gracefully as I can think of and even that's a pretty ugly way to do it.  There's probably a nicer way to do it, but I'd start with the keylogger and build from there.
