How can I activate Mac speech without pressing a key? <body> I just bought a microphone to test built in mac speech. On the speech preference, I can choose which keyboard key to make mac to listen to my voice.  Is it possible to make my mac to listen continuously without pressing a key?  I know that I can make mac listen to me without a voice command (ex: mac, [command]), but i don't like it..  <answer30659> This is quoted directly from the Speech Recognition Settings preferences:  hr  Listen only while key is pressed:     With Speakable Items turned on, you can also select this method by   speaking the command “strongTurn on push-to-talk./strong”   Listen continuously with keyword:     Use the “strongKeyword is/strong” pop-up menu to change when you need to speak the   keyword. Use the Keyword field to specify what the keyword is.   hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QByVr.png" alt="Speech Recognition Settings preferences"
