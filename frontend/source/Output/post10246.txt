how many devices can be registered for ios Enterprise programme <body> I am working in a big organization where I want to distribute application with 300 different devices.   I came to know that ios Enterprise programme is available for such a big in house distribution ,   But I want to know how many device can be registered with such programe ?   With simple developer programe with ad-hock profile we are able to register  100 different devices that I know but with enterprise I do not have any idea.  If any one know then please let me know.  thanks in advance...  <answer10269> I'm pretty sure it's strongunlimited/strong, tho I couldn't confirm it from any official source. There are reports of people using it for way over 300 devices, tho, so you should be fine.  <answer48053> Actually, it's also 100 for the developer provisioning profile. But if the application is distributed using the distribution provisioning profile and not developer provisioning profile, it's unlimited.   <comment10760> Thanks Cawas foe this information
