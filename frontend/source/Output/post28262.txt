How can I delete contact relationships in Siri? <body> Today something really stupid happened to me. To show the new iPhone I gave it to a friend at work. He activated Siri and said:  "Call my father"  Siri said : "Who is your father?"  My friend said his name and since he was in the address book contacts the phone called his number. Now every time I say "Call my father" my friends number is called. How can I delete this "relationship" and where is it stored?  <answer28263> According to this Apple discussion forum, the way to modify the contact is:  ol liGo to strongSettings/strong-strongGeneral/strong-strongSiri/strong/li liTap 'strongMy Info/strong' /li liChange the wrong profile to the correct contact/li /ol  Alternately, you can also follow the instructions from this post:     Set up a contact for yourself and edit it to add a field   "relationship" or something like that.
