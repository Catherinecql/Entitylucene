How can I upload HD video from iPhone 4 directly to web? <body> How can I upload HD video from iPhone 4 directly to web?   <answer1789> The Flickr app will allow you to do this.  <answer1790> h1Pixelpipe/h1  From https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/3486/is-there-a-way-to-upload-higher-resolution-videos-to-youtube-or-any-video-sharin     This strongfree app allows iPhone 4 users to   directly upload their 720P videos to   YouTube/strong, as well as Flickr, Facebook,   MobileMe, Viddler, Posterous and a   whole slew of other video sharing   sites. The app evens works via email   and FTP. The only caveat is that the   videos cannot be over 200 MB in size.   strongRegarding with how to use it, check out this post:  http://islandinthenet.com/2010/07/06/pixelpipe-upload-720p-hd-video-from-iphone-4-to-youtube/ I recommend that post, it gives some great information on the app and how it is used./strong  For example:     A “pipe” is the   connector between the PixelPipe app   and one or more destination sites   where you want your content to be   uploaded. For example, I set up pipes   for flickr, picasa, and Dropbox and   many others.      I setup some of my pipes as default   routes. This means that any media I   select to upload will automatically go   to these default pipes.       For each pipe   I created, PixelPipe created a routing   tag. The routing tag explicitly tells   PixelPipe where to upload the content   overriding any default routes. If you   want your content routed to different   photo sets you can create a routing   pipe and tag for each one.   Also, given this:     since other developers are sure to create a similar product now that they know it is possible to upload 720p videos.   strongIf you don't like the PixelPipe app, it shouldn't be too long before another solution pops up :)/strong  According to this page, an app called strongSmugMug is also 720p uploading enabled/strong, however I couldn't find much in reference to that on their site. http://www.tuaw.com/2010/07/01/want-to-upload-720p-from-iphone-4-try-pixelpipe/  <answer12464> There are many apps that do this. I like the following for ease of use and design. I'll rank them in the order of the quality of the final video (and coincidentally overall usability)  ul liiMovie - very slick, great editing, many upload options like YouTube, Vimeo and others/li liPosterous - very powerful blogging tool for free./li liVimeo - free but not [yet] as slick as iMovie/li /ul  One last mention is a live streaming app called Ustream Live Broadcaster - I don't really use it but it's unlike the rest in that it's more of a broadcast tool than for pushing something you captured to the web once the video is complete.  <comment1560> I see you had ask it on webapps, but it is probably more appropriate on this site. http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/3486/is-there-a-way-to-upload-higher-resolution-videos-to-youtube-or-any-video-sharin
