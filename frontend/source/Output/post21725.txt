How can I get a list of all iPhone pictures that are imported to iPhoto? <body> I have used iPhoto to backup my pictures from the iPhone. How can I find all the iPhone-photos without having to click on all the pictures to view the EXIF-info?  <answer21726> You can create a smart album with a condition on the camera model (Camera model includes "iPhone").  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKbPp.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's even possible to select the front or rear camera by adding a condition on the aperture. See this hints for details.  I believe iPhoto '09 has this - the picture above is in iPhoto '11 and it works great there.  <answer21727> You can define a smart album and select by camera model.
