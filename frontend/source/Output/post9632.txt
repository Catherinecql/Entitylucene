Center Window on Screen <body> I'm creating a few screen casts and wanted to exactly center my windows in my screen. Any good way to do this on the Mac? I found an Apple Script example (and a few linked screens) but none of them support centering 'Terminal' vertically (although they do support centering other applications vertically).  <answer9635> If you want to exactly center them (so horizontally and vertically) then you can use the example given in the comments on the site you linked to, and adapt the answer posted to this stackoverflow question.  I ended up with this:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell application "Finder"     set {posx, posy, screenWidth, screenHeight} to bounds of window of desktop end tell  tell application "Terminal" to set {windowLeft, windowTop, windowRight, windowBottom} to bounds of window 1  set windowWidth to windowRight - windowLeft set windowHeight to windowBottom - windowTop  set newBounds to {¬     ((screenWidth - windowWidth) / 2), ¬     ((screenHeight - windowHeight) / 2), ¬     ((screenWidth + windowWidth) / 2), ¬     ((screenHeight + windowHeight) / 2) ¬         }  set newPosition to {¬     ((screenWidth - windowWidth) / 2), ¬     ((screenHeight - windowHeight) / 2) ¬         }  tell application "Terminal" to set bounds of window 1 to newBounds tell application "Terminal" to set position of window 1 to newPosition /code/pre  Keep in mind that this will center codewindow 1/code, so if you happen to use tools like Visor, you will have to use codewindow 2/code instead.  <answer9637> An alternative is MercuryMover. 'Center window' is one of the built-in shortcuts.  You can move windows around with shortcuts, define custom positions - and do some more. Hint: try the preference file to define custom pixel numbers other than 1, 10, 100.  It is expensive with $20, but pays over time. Anyway, there's an old-school trial… MacUpdate: MercuryMover  <answer9641> Not sure if this might do what you are looking for as well, but Divvy is also a neat piece of software for arranging windows.   I suggest you watch the screencast on their website to see if it does what you are looking for, but basically it has a grid where you can change the size and position of the frontmost window.   You can also change the grid it displays to have finer control over the size of the windows you are working with.  Hope this helps.  <answer9652> I enjoy using SizeUp to manage windows, one of which is a center on screen option. Good luck.  <answer9741> Kevin. I’m the author of the post that you linked to on incrementalism.net.  The reason the Terminal window moves to the top is just a bug in Terminal’s AppleScript support.  This version does the vertical centering and works around the Terminal bug:  precodetell application "Finder"     set screenSize to bounds of window of desktop     set screenWidth to item 3 of screenSize     set screenHeight to item 4 of screenSize end tell  tell application "System Events"     set myFrontMost to name of first item of ¬         (processes whose frontmost is true) end tell  try     tell application myFrontMost         set windowSize to bounds of window 1         set windowXl to item 1 of windowSize         set windowYt to item 2 of windowSize         set windowXr to item 3 of windowSize         set windowYb to item 4 of windowSize          set windowWidth to windowXr - windowXl         set windowHeight to windowYb - windowYt          if myFrontMost is "Terminal" then             set bounds of window 1 to {¬                 round ((screenWidth - windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬                 round ((screenHeight + windowHeight) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬                 round ((screenWidth + windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬                 round ((screenHeight + windowHeight) / 2 + windowHeight) rounding as taught in school}         else             set bounds of window 1 to {¬                 round ((screenWidth - windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬                 round ((screenHeight - windowHeight) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬                 round ((screenWidth + windowWidth) / 2) rounding as taught in school, ¬                 round ((screenHeight + windowHeight) / 2) rounding as taught in school}         end if          set the result to bounds of window 1      end tell end try /code/pre  I hope that helps, if you haven’t already paid for one of the other options. I also added a comment with this workaround to the original post.  <answer9742> Fixes for:  ul liThe bug with Terminal/li liWeird process names (firefox-bin)/li liSizes of menu bar and Dock/li liApplescript support disabled in Preview/li liWindows that are almost full width / height will be resized to full width / height /li /ul  Remarks:  ul licoderounding as taught in school/code isn't really needed ul lithe default is coderounding to nearest/code, which rounds .5 to the nearest even integer (e.g 22.5 to 22)/li /ul/li liReally, mixedCase variable names emeven here/em?/li /ul  Still, there's a dozen more things that could go wrong. The Dock part isn't really needed if you have hiding always turned on.

Just downloaded it and it looks almost perfect! <comment10089> @IntutionHQ Thanks! That looks very promising! <comment10090> I tried this script but for some reason it is locking my terminal to the top of the screen. Maybe it is because I'm using the transparent terminal or something. <comment10092> possible duplicate of [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x)
