How can I make a note in a Kindle book in Kindle for Mac? <body> On the Amazon site, it says:     Click on any word or click and drag over a passage to create a highlight or add a note within a book. Once you've selected text, a pop-up box gives you the option to Highlight, Add Note, Copy, or the More dropdown menu.   But that doesn't seem to work in the Kindle application I have on my Mac.  Is there a way to add a note in a book in Kindle for Mac?  <answer29700> You have to download the latest version (1.8.1 as of this writing) directly from Amazon, the updater doesn't seem to pick it up automatically.  <answer122429> I was moments from posting     "I also have the same question.br    I have just downloaded the latest version, so it can't be that reason..."   ...then I figured out the problem in my case:   Even though I was viewing text, it was in a graphic.  Text in the book worked just fine.  It was the graphic that didn't let me annotate.    Best of luck!
