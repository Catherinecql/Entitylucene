how to get Time Machine backup overnight instead of every hour? <body> My (older) iMac runs 24/7 and it seems like it's constantly doing Time Machine backups which slows down things considerably.  My wife is always complaining about beach balls.  Is there a way to configure Time Machine to do backups only in the wee hours of the morning?  <answer18847> Use TimeMachineEditor. Free. Doesn't say, but it works on Lion too.     TimeMachineEditor is a software for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard that lets you change the default one-hour backup interval of Time Machine.   You can change the interval or create a more sophisticated scheduling (see screenshot below).      This is useful if you don’t need to backup every hour and don’t want   the performance penalty. This is also especially useful if you   manipulate lots of data within one hour as you would spend the whole   day backing up.   <answer18848> I have been using TimeMachineScheduler for this purpose for quite some time now. You can set it up to make backups only at certain hours.  <answer18849> There's a nice looking piece of freeware worth trying called Time Machine Editor which looks like it'll do the trick.  <answer18850> You can change the sync interval - you can in this link read how to do this: http://maketecheasier.com/change-your-time-machine-backup-interval/2009/06/05  The link also show a 3-part Time Machine Editor.
