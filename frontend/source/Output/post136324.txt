Moving finder window from one display to another <body> Would it be possible to create an AppleScript to instantly drag one screen from one screen to another (say, center of the second screen)?  <answer136326> Try this:  precode--  Window Moving Script between multiple monitors for Apple Mac OS X 10.x -- (something I've been doing with UltraMon for quite a while) --  inspired by: --     http://www.tidbits.com/webx?14@@.3c7b1ae3/5 --     http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=24511 -- and http://daringfireball.net/2006/12/display_size_applescript_the_lazy_way -- thanx for the input ...

Use Butler, Keyboard Maestro, etc. to create a hotkey and it works great.  (Original post found here.)  <comment274860> This is nicely done but it assumes the two monitors are arranged side-by-side. I'd love to see it determine the configuration and adapt.
