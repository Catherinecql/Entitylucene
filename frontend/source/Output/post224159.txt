iMac crashes after adding extra memory, any idea why? <body> My 2010 27" iMac just received a RAM upgrade: I bought a 16 GB RAM kit by Crucial on amazon. The specification meets this iMac model's requirement, and it has nice ratings.  So right now the memory seats are two 2 GB original RAM + two 8 GB Crucial RAM . The system boots perfectly fine, but when I perform heavy duty tasks or run Rember memory test app, it completely crashes. I have attached two photos that show the RAM seats and crash screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8H2BN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Do you think there's any problems with the RAM I just bought or the way I installed them? Please let me know what you think?  Update:  I did some experientment with the 4 RAM slots and combinations, see below:  Top: Two original 2 GB RAM. Bottom: Two Crucial 8 GB RAM. Result: Can boot into system perfectly fine, crashes when perform heavy duty tasks or run Rember RAM testing.  Top: Two original 2 GB RAM. Bottom: None. Results: Boot perfectly fine, doesn't crash when perform heavy duty task and run Rember RAM testing.  Top: Two Crucial 8 GB RAM.br Bottom: None.br Results: Doesn't boot into system, stuck at the white screen with a gray apple icon (without seeing progress/ loading circle).  Top: None.

however, as I suspected, that is one of the few iMacs from that period that cannot take more than 16GB RAM.  I'm struggling to find data on whether it can specifically use 2x 8GB RAM sticks, though your own experiments would seem to say it cannot &amp; that its maximum configuration would be 4x 4GB sticks.  Info source : Everymac - Aluminum iMac Q&amp;A  emExtract/em     † Specifically note that the 21.5" models from the Mid-2010 line (iMac11,2) and the entry-level 27-Inch model -- the iMac "Core i3" 3.2 27-Inch (Mid-2010) -- only support 16 GB of RAM whereas all models from the Mid-2011 line -- 21.5" and 27" -- actually support 32 GB of RAM. If you have a 21.5" model (or the entry-level 27-Inch "Core i3" powered Mid-2010 iMac), please be very certain to identify it precisely to avoid potential disappointment when upgrading the RAM. The 21.5" Mid-2010 models use the 2389 EMC number whereas the 21.5" Mid-2011 models use 2428.   As you are still running Snow Leopard - there is a possibility that the 8GB stick might work if you install the 64-bit firmware update [which so far I'm not able to track down, but you should check Apple Menu  Software Update, just in case]  <answer225912> I'd like to post an update: I have purchased two Corsair 4GB ram sticks. They work perfectly and passed the memory test. It is indeed a memory compatibility issue - My 27" Imac doesn't take 8GB ram sticks!  Thank you all for your help!   <comment271819> Welcome to Ask Different. It may be helpful to provide any messages that appear before the time of the crash (from the System Log in Console), and any crash reports (also from Console). They may help identify the cause. <comment271822> We also need to know very specifically which iMac model it is, From About this Mac  System Report… Hardware overview, Model Name, Model Identifier & processor speed. iMacs from that period may support more than 16GB RAM, but only very specific models. Also, what OS you're running, as also some provisos apply. <comment271825> Hello Netherlinks, I have added the error messages. please see updates <comment271828> Hi @Tetsujin I have added the information you asked for in the new image. I looked it up on apple's website, this iMac is identified as a mid 2010 model. Is it running snow leopard <comment271832> Hey Tetsujin,  Thank you so much for helping me and providing this great resource and answer! I will contact the manufacture and see if I'm able to get an exchange for 4GB rams. Somehow I believed that my Imac was able to take 8GB RAM sticks for up to 32GB in total. Apparently I was wrong :(  Everymac is such a great resource, thanks again for sharing I hope this thread will help other people too :)  Cheers!
