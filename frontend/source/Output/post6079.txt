MacBook Pro running Linux - only 3.6 GB RAM available <body> (This is a repost of my question on SuperUser.com, hopefully it's better suited here ).  I've happily installed Linux on my MacBook Pro with 4 GB of RAM, but I only get 3.6 GB available:  precoderobert@raptor ~$ free -m              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached Mem:          3684       2184       1500          0         83       1096 -/+ buffers/cache:       1004       2680 Swap:         6149          0       6149 /code/pre  I'm running a 64-bit kernel so this should not be a problem:  precoderobert@raptor ~$ uname -a Linux raptor 2.6.34.7-0.5-desktop #1 SMP PREEMPT 2010-10-25 08:40:12 +0200 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux /code/pre  What can I do to get the whole 4 GB available?  hr  emUpdate/em: this is what I get when running codetop/code on MacOS X:  precodePhysMem: 540M wired, 640M active, 231M inactive, 1411M used, 2685M free. /code/pre  where used + free = 4096 MB.  emUpdate 2/em: There's a thread on MacRumors.com where a user complains of the same problem with Windows 7/64 bit.  emUpdate 3/em: code/proc/meminfo/code output:  precodeMemTotal:        3773288 kB MemFree:         1164244 kB Buffers:          109096 kB Cached:          1270520 kB SwapCached:            0 kB Active:          1446756 kB Inactive:         962728 kB Active(anon):     803404 kB Inactive(anon):   230556 kB Active(file):     643352 kB Inactive(file):   732172 kB Unevictable:           0 kB Mlocked:               0 kB SwapTotal:       6297596 kB SwapFree:        6297596 kB Dirty:               792 kB Writeback:             0 kB AnonPages:       1029880 kB Mapped:           185096 kB Shmem:              4096 kB Slab:             131260 kB SReclaimable:     106212 kB SUnreclaim:        25048 kB KernelStack:        2680 kB PageTables:        21248 kB NFS_Unstable:          0 kB Bounce:                0 kB WritebackTmp:          0 kB CommitLimit:     8184240 kB Committed_AS:    3113016 kB VmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB VmallocUsed:      123884 kB VmallocChunk:   34359596028 kB HardwareCorrupted:     0 kB HugePages_Total:       0 HugePages_Free:        0 HugePages_Rsvd:        0 HugePages_Surp:        0 Hugepagesize:       2048 kB DirectMap4k:       54444 kB DirectMap2M:     3852288 kB /code/pre  Memory info from codedmesg/code:  precode[    0.000000] Memory: 3759972k/5242880k available (4780k kernel code, 1336600k absent, 146308k reserved, 6603k data, 892k init) /code/pre  <answer6080> Some of the memory is used by the hardware -- for example, most MacBook Pros have 256MB of main memory used by the graphics adaptor. OS X knows about this and can account for it, but Linux doesn't. Your Linux installation has access to all of the available memory.  <answer84653> Mike Scott is right, and to give some ground to his statements I want to add something.  The output from code/proc/meminfo/code you give is quite interesting. It give you a total memory of 3773288 kB (or 3.6 GB). The procfs documentation tells you that codeMemTotal/code as reported by meminfo corresponds to "Total usable ram (i.e. physical ram minus a few reserved bits and the kernel binary code)". So you have about 400 MB used for the firmware and the kernel image. Firmware could include BootCamp and the graphical memory. For the kernel, it is a bit more complicated to know, you would have to properly unzipped your kernel (code/boot/vmlinuz.../code) to know the right size it takes in memory.
