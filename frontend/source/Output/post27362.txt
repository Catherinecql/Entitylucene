How can I add an audio menu in the Finder? <body> What is the easiest way to add menu item to finder that switched audio from internal to external(headphone). I have to switch back and forth often and going into control panel every time is a pain in Snow leopard. Is there a way to do this with Applescript?  <answer27363> You can kbd&#x2325;/kbd-click the volume menu in the menu bar to quickly select which audio output device to use.  <answer27364> There are two ways that I know of.  Hold option and click on the volume icon in the finder to get a list of input/output options.  The other option is to download an app called SoundSource.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZcTU.png" alt="SoundSource"
