How can I back up a computer with PGP whole disk encryption enabled? <body> My mac has PGP whole disk encryption (WDE) installed.  I would like to back up my entire drive.  However, the backup must also be encrypted (although not necessarily with PGP WDE).  I need to be able to completely restore the computer (system files, etc.) from this backup.  The only instructions I have found for backing up such a drive are for Windows: HOW TO: Create Backup Images of Whole Disk Encrypted Drives or files.  I am on Snow Leopard so an encrypted File Vault backup is not an option for me.  Is there any way to create a byte-for-byte image of my disk?  <answer26557> See this article in the PGP forum. It recommends to enable WDE on the target and then use SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to transfer data (or restore from Time Machine).
