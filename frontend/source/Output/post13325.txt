Shiny new Macbook Pro -- can oils and sweat damage the screen? <body> I have a brand-new Macbook Pro. As I'm almost certainly going to eventually spill something into the keyboard, I picked up a keyboard skin. It only took me a few hours to get used to typing with it; skins have come a long way since the last time I had one on a Mac.    I'm noticing that there's now a faint residue left on the screen, possibly the sweat or oils from my fingertips and palms. (I notice that I lean on the edge of the skin as I type.)   Is this anything that could eventually cause screen damage?   <answer13327> The screen is glass, so it's highly unlikely that sweat can damage it.  <answer13330> Although its unlikely that sweat/oil from fingers will do lasting damage to your screen (in the normal lifespan of a laptop), I would only caution on ensuring that when you periodically clean these stains off that you use a very soft cloth (like the black one that came with your new Macbook Pro).  I've seen a lot of monitors that have been scratched through the use of incorrect cleaning cloths or abrasive cleaning solutions.  <comment14526> I hadn't appreciated that the LCD panel itself is under a piece of glass! Excellent point.
