Experience with iLugger? <body> I have an iMac and I use it for development and video editing. I am looking for greater portability and I'm considering a MacBook or MacBook Pro. My other option is an iLugger.   I'm looking for owners of iLugger to share their experiences with iLugger and if it is a worthy buy.  <answer4824> I love my iLugger!!!!  You get exactly what you pay for. The only con I can say is the weight upon your shoulder, when using the shoulder strap.. Looks like they added wheels now, so this definitely is a good buy.
