Is there a way to snooze the reminder for a calendar event on iPhone? <body> Is it possible to snooze a reminder for a calendar event when the reminder shows up? I have my calendar set up through an exchange server and would like a snooze feature so I can be reminded of the event 2 or 4 hours after the original notification. If this is not possible is there a good app for recurring events with push notification?  <answer3615> This is not supported by the default calendar app at the moment. An app called Calendar Alarm from the App Store might be what you're looking for. Its listed features include:     ul   liWorks seamlessly together with all   iPhone supported calendars (Google   Calendar, CalDAV, Outlook, Exchange,   iCal)./li   liSnooze function with intervals of your choice./li   /ul
