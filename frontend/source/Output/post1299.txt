Shortcut keys mapper viewer/checker available? <body> Is there a tool or method to check what shortcut key is mapped to what?  I used Command-Space for special purposes, after installing this and that, and changing this and that, when I click Command-Space, I see some black screen showing 'No items selected'. It seems that the Finder or something hooks the key, but I'm not sure.  Any idea?  I find that Key Cue shows the assigned shortcuts for everything. I wish, I can get the same information.  <answer1304> Try System Preferences-Keyboard and look at the Keyboard shortcuts tab  <comment1109> Normally QuickLook (the feature in your screenshot) is mapped to *just* space and/or Command-Y.
