What is the safest way to move the iTunes Library from one hard drive to another? <body> This may happen later with my iMac, but right now it is happening for my iTunes on PC.  The PC had 60GB of partition to install Windows 7, and right now it is down to about 2GB of free space.  All iTunes purchases, including Music and Movies, are downloaded to  precodeC:\Users\mike\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Music  C:\Users\mike\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Movies /code/pre  which will make the codeC:/code drive have less and less free space.  (and codeC:/code will be more healthy if it has at least a couple of GB of free space).  What is the safest, most proper way to migrate all the media to an external hard drive codeJ:/code ?  On codeJ:/code, the path might be:  precodeJ:\iTunes\iTunes Media\Music /code/pre  or  precodeJ:\iTunes Media\Music /code/pre  My guess is that we can change the folder in iTunes, but won't iTunes go to that folder or create it, and find nothing, and index everything wrong?  So, should an exact copy of codeC:\Users\mike\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media/code be made as codeJ:\iTunes Media/code first (probably 30GB of files copying), and then start iTunes and change the preference for the folder to the codeJ:/code one?  Is there a standard or official method to do this?  <answer31393> You're actually on to the right approach. This Apple support article details the following approach for Windows (and this is the approach for a Mac user):  ol liOpen iTunes./li liChoose Edit  Preferences./li liClick the Advanced tab in the Preferences window./li liSelect the "Keep iTunes Media folder organized" checkbox./li liClick OK./li /ol  If you haven't been letting iTunes keep your media organized up until now, you'll have to wait while it sorts everything out. Could take a few hours. Have beverages handy.  Once it's done sorting things out you can change the location of the iTunes library and iTunes will shuffle everything over to the new spot. From that article:  ol liOpen iTunes./li liFrom the Edit menu, choose Preferences./li liClick the Advanced tab in the Preferences window./li liClick the Change button in the iTunes Media folder location pane./li liIn the Change Media Folder Location window that appears, navigate to the location where you would like your new Media folder to be created./li liClick the Make New Folder button in the Change Media Folder Location window./li liEnter the name of the new iTunes Media folder./li liClick OK in the Change Media Folder Location window. Click OK in the Advanced window. ul liFor iTunes 9 and 10: Choose File  Library  Organize Library/li liFor iTunes 8: Choose File  Library  Consolidate Library/li liFor iTunes 7 or earlier: Choose Advanced  Consolidate Library./li /ul/li liA message will pop up. ul liFor iTunes 9 and 10: Place a check next to "Consolidate files" and click OK./li liFor iTunes 8 and earlier: Click Consolidate./li /ul/li liAfter the folder has been copied, locate your original iTunes Media folder, and drag it to the Recycle Bin. Important: Don't remove the iTunes Library files that may be in the same location as the iTunes Media folder. For more information about the iTunes Library files, see What are the iTunes Library files?/li liQuit and reopen iTunes. ul liIf you receive the alert: "The folder containing "iTunes Library.itl" cannot be found and is required. Please create or choose an iTunes library," you most likely moved the iTunes Library files. If this is the case, move them out of the Recycle Bin and back to where they were./li liIf you do not encounter the above alert when opening and closing iTunes, empty the Recycle Bin./li /ul/li /ol  Circa iTunes 9.x I used this (nearly) same approach to move my library from my main hard drive on my iMac to my Drobo and can confirm that it works.  <answer31408> Gary Rosenzweig of "MacMost Now" video podcasts has done a very nice 6 minute tutorial.  MacMost Now 631: Moving Your iTunes Media To an External Drive     "If your internal drive is getting full and you want to move your iTunes music to an external drive, you can do so by using   functions built right into iTunes. Keep your iTunes Library on your   internal drive, but move your music to an external drive. That way you   move the bulk of your files to your external drive, but keep all of   the primary functionality of your iTunes Library on your internal   one."

Then wait while it syncs. Then you've got it in the cloud to be pulled down on any copy of iTunes or any iOS device you want to get to it from.  That's the safest. Not the cheapest, but the safest, and one of the easiest
