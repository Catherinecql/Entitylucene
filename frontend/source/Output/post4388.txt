Avoid having to select "Include Network Devices" every time when scanning in Preview <body> I set up a wireless HP Printer for my mother, prints and scans just fine. The annoying thing is that every single time we try to scan in Preview, we first have to do the following:  ol liSelect File  Import from Scanner  Include Networked Devices/li liSelect File  Import from Scanner  Printer name/li /ol  Is there a way to avoid having to do that first step every time? Didn't see a preference in Preview and obviously we aren't going to keep it running all of the time. :)  <answer4536> precodetell application "Preview"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "Preview"         tell menu bar 1             tell menu bar item "File"                 tell menu "File"                     tell menu item "Import from Scanner"                         tell menu "Import from Scanner"                             click menu item "Include Networked Devices"                             -- added a delay because the list of networked printers doesn't appear immediately.

I am going to guess that codeclick menu item "Printer name"/code will have to be changed as I don't think the menu item really says "Printer name", I'm guessing it says something like "HP OfficeJet 6500". Make sure that all menu names match.  Save the script as either an application, which can be launched from the dock, or a script, which can be run from the AppleScript menu bar item.  Note, I believe that you must enable "Enable access for assistive devices" in the "Universal Access" preference pane of System Preferences for this to work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9Eff.png" alt="Enable access for assistive devices"  <answer9107> That answer is very well done, but an even better option is to use "image capture".
