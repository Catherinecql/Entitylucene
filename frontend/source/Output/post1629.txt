Am I missing something by using outdated data cable and wall charger? <body> My wife has iPhone 3G and I recently bought iPhone 4 for myself. Since we can easily manage charging for both of our phones from just one wall charger, I actually never unpackaged mine and data cable is still packed as well.  But few days ago I noticed that my phone refusing to sync with even older data cable (from 3rd gen iPod nano) although iPhone 3G does sync with it.  So that got me thinking, do I missing something by not using updated accessories? Faster charging time or data sync maybe? Any thoughts?  <answer1631> I have a total of 5 charging cables (and my partner has another 4) ranging from the 3G days until now. I still use my original 3G cable (the one where you had to press buttons on the side to release it) to plug my iPhone 4 into my iMac, and nothing has gone wrong so far :)  <answer2541> I'm using the same cables across all my Apple devices (I have so many around, and can't really tell them apart any more).  One bit of caution regarding the strongwall plug/strong, though: there was one model that shipped with either the original iPhone or the 3G which was recalled because it was prone to overheating.  If you haven't run into a problem with yours by now, it's probably not an issue.  Just wanted to offer the heads-up.  <comment2244> FYI it was with the iPhone 3G.
