Replacement DVD drive for MacBook Pro <body> Howdy. I have a MacBook Pro 15" (MB133LL/A) with a Matsushita UJ-867 DVD drive. The DVD drive is failing and I'm looking for a replacement.  Are there any other supported drives for this machine than the UJ-867?  <answer8578> There are some variations in the drives supplied in Apple's products. For example, often Apple will have multiple suppliers for a part, and products often have hardware options. As such there will be other drives that are supported.  I find sites such as iFixIt or Other World Computing that are targeting DIY repair and upgrades are helpful as they provide a guide to which parts are compatible with various Mac and MacBook models.  Here are some results for your MacBook Pro:  ul li15" MacBook Pro optical drives at iFixIt/li li15" MacBook Pro SuperDrives at OWC/li /ul
